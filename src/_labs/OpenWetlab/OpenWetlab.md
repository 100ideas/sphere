The Open WetLab is a leading place for bio-art, biodesign and do-it-together biology in the heart of Amsterdam. It works together with artists, designers, scientists, and hackers at public participation projects.

The Lab regularly organizes well-visited meet-ups. Beside that, artists and students can work in the lab as artistic researcher-in-residence and new biohackers are trained at the BioHack Academy: an international highly acclaimed course for biohackers, initiated by Pieter van Boheemen. The BioHack Academy learns individuals to build their own lab, create bio experiments, and teaches the basics of synthetic biology and critical reflection.
