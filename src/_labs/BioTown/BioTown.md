Biotown is a community-run open-access laboratory in Ottawa, Canada. With ever decreasing barriers for entry into scientific research, DIYBio spaces, like ours, are starting a global revolution in scientific understanding and experimentation. Our goal is to provide individuals, both amateur and experts, with the tools and knowledge to solve complex problems using biotechnology.
The National Capital Region is home to four Universities, two Colleges, two Provinces and the Federal Government; it is also one of North Americaâ€™s most active technology hubs. We hope to leverage the creative potential of our unique location to both produce ground-breaking research and shape policy decisions in ways that benefit the arts, sciences and technology fields. If this all sounds cool to you, we hope you drop by some time!
