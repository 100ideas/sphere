We are a nonprofit group with a common vision: biological experimentation should be available to everyone!


We are establishing a community lab, open to the public. The lab will serve entrepreneurs, hobbyists, students, artists and anyone who just wants to do biology him/herself.
We also organize workshops, lectures and courses.
Feel free to share the group in order to help the community grow.
