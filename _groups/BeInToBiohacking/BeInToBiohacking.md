The large Fablab Torino strength is the variety of skills of its associates; the curiosity that prompted us to look for new areas brought us in close contact with the world of molecular biology. From this contact was born the bio hackers community BE.IN.TO group ( BioHacking Experience in Turin ). Contamination between the various skills of its members led to the birth of some projects, some under development and others presented for the first time at Maker Faire Rome 2014. The group was founded by the interest of Castagna Riccardo, Valentina Margaria, Enrico Bassi, Stefano Paradiso, Garda Fabrizio and Alessandro Ardzhenio.

The interests of the BE.IN.TO group ranging in different activities that start with a ctivities Base to discover the world of BioHacking; a journey through the experiences around the world with hands-on experiments. Then there are the  activities of planning and design to seek alternative applications of design and experimentation. Hardware and instrumentation laboratory to understand how the digital fabrication allows to support scientific research. Finally  d iscussioni around the themes of Bio commons, ethics and the creation of research protocols with the aim of putting into effect the scientific value by moving the eyes of the traditional search.
