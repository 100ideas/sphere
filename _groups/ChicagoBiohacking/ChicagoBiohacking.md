This is a group for experimenters and hackers, people who question how we work and how we could work better. We'll explore the techniques and technologies available to optimize our health and performance, including nutrition, sleep, supplements, nootropics, biofeedback, meditation, neurofeedback, etc. If you are a self-hacker, join the group, share your story, and continue to learn through experimentation with this dedicated Chicago community.
