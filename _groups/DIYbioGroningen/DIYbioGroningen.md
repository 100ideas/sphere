A vibrant community of Makers and DIY biologists are aiming to rethink the way we approach science. In our first events we will introduce the initiative and discuss an open-source, do-it-yourself PCR machine: the starting point for DNA analysis.


We believe that publicly-accessible biotechnology has the potential to benefit everyone.
