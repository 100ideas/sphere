We aim to provide interactive learning environments to foster the intrinsic curiosity of anyone who would like to learn more about microbial life. The format addresses citizens of all educational levels and is mainly intended to spark genuine interest. An online platform will provide a general overview about microbial ecosystems with the intention to fill the gap between popular science and specialist literature. Our workshops bring people together, to create an experience that reaches far beyond the acquisition of knowledge.
