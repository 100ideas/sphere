A small intellectual and cultural movement composed of young science and engineering professionals, students, advocates, hobbyists and enthusiasts who are organizing to create public awareness about the current technologies in the biological and chemical sciences which can be applied in one's own backyard or garage.

The group members are dedicated to making biology an accessible pursuit for every Filipino who wants to be involved in scientific research and development even if they do not have enough background. The group also aims to educate Filipinos about the basic principles of biotechnology, bioethics and biosafety.
