Welcome to the Israeli DIYbio group. The purposes of the group are to promote conversation about DIYbio in Israel, create a place for relevant discussion and advance social gatherings. The long reaching goal will be to promote the establishment of a community lab that will be open to the public and expose it to the world of biology.
Feel free to share the group in order to help the community grow.
