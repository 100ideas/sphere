The Cap City Biohackers are dedicated to demystifying and democratizing science (with an emphasis on biology and technology) for people of all backgrounds. Founded by Drs. David Taffany and Jessica Fleming in Columbus in 2015, the Cap City Biohackers are a part of the world-wide DIYBio movement and the first established DIYBio group in Ohio. Since its founding, the Cap City Biohackers have formed a strong community around citizen science, including monthly lectures, discussions, and hands-on demonstrations. We're currently working toward establishing a dedicated community lab at Rev1 Ventures. Check out our events on Facebook and get involved!
