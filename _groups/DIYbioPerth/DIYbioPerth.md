DIYbio Perth is a community – open to all – driven by curiosity, openness and sharing. We aim to help democratise biology, biotechnology and life sciences by bringing together students, researchers and hobbyists. We want to start a conversation of ideas between engineers, biologists, artists, teachers, and anyone else willing to explore the merging universes of bio+tech, through interaction, collaborative projects, workshops and social events.
