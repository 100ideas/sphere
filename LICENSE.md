# License for humans
This is a human-readable text to explain in simple english the permissions granted to use, share, and adapt the Work of the DIYbiosphere. It is not a substitute for the legal documents which can be found in the root folder of the DIYbiosphere repository ([here](CC-BY-SA 4.0.md) and [here](MPL 2.0.md)) and through external links below.

## Types of Work
The DIYbiosphere is a mixed project composed by various types of Work:
-  (Creative) **Content** means literary and/or artistic work and includes all written text, pictures, graphic design, etc.
- **Data** is all factual information, such as dates, and addresses, etc.
- ** Documentation** includes all the guides, tutorials, and reference manuals that pertain to the project
-  **Code** is all the source-code that builds and formats the content into the website

> **Overall the Work is divided as _Content_, which includes the Data and Documentation, and the underlying _Source-Code_ that transforms and displays that content.**

## Aplicable Licenses
The **Content is licensed** under the [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 International] (CC BY-SA 4.0), which allows for use and modification as long as you share the work under the same license and give credit to the original author of the work.

The **Source Code is licensed**  under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0] (MPL-2.0), which allows for use and modifications as long as you share the source-code under the same license. You can also combine MPL source code with other code under a different license (open or proprietary) as long as the MPL source code is made available.

## Summary
You can download the data and content, and code and use for ANY purpose you like; personal, community, educational, commercial, government, etc. There are only two requirements:
#### Attribute and Share-Alike!
Our requested attribution is “© DIYbiosphere contributors”.
Because DIYbiosphere  _is_ its contributors you may omit the word “contributors” if space is limited.

We would greatly appreciate, prefer, and encourage you to add your derivative work to the DIYbiosphere project, but you don’t have too. If you _do_ distribute your derivative work then it must be made public with the same license.

> **You must make it clear that the data and content is available under CC-BY-SA 4.0 and that the underlying source code is available under MPL 2.0.
