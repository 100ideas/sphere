**All the work in this project, except where otherwise noted\*, is freely available to use, modify and distribute** :two_hearts:

The project covers two types of Work which require different copyright terms.

Overall the Work in this Project is divided as:

- the **Database** which includes all the Content (text, images) and Data in the entries and is dedicated to the Public Domain with [CC0][cc0], which allows for a completely free use of the work.
    - You can: use, modify, distribute original or derivative works for ANY purpose; personal, commercial, etc.
    - You cannot: hold liable, or make patent claims.

- the **Software** is the underlying source-code (HTML, JS, YAML, CSS, etc.) that transforms and displays that content and is available under the [MIT License][mit] (including its supporting documentation), which allows for free use, as long as you share copies with the copyright and license notice.
    - You can: use, modify, sublicense, distribute original or derivative works for ANY purpose; personal, commercial, etc.
    - You cannot: hold the author liable.
    - You must: include the copyright and license notice in all copies or substantial uses of the work.

All Contributions Submitted to the Project are shared under these copyright terms. You can review the the Contributor Terms or "Contributor License Agreement" ([CLA][cla]) to understand in legal terms the authorship rights granted and/or waived from your Contributions.

### Copyright Attribution
You may attribute our Work as "© DIYbiosphere contributors" to recognize the amazing effort of our contributors. If space is limited, attribute as "© DIYbiosphere".

#### *otherwise noted
Contributions that are shared/uploaded to the Database part should explicitly note their copyright terms if the author(s) do not waive authorship or grant rights to their work. For example, you may upload an image that is hosted in Flickr if the copyright is CC-BY, in which case the caption must have a link to the original source and a note on the copyright license.

Please follow our instructions for [noting copyright][noting-copyright].
