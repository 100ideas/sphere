-  **(Creative) Content** means literary and/or artistic work and includes all written text, pictures, graphic design, etc.
- **Data** is all factual information, such as dates, and addresses, etc.
- **Documentation** includes all the guides, tutorials, and reference manuals that pertain to the project
-  **Code** is all the source-code that builds and formats the content into the website

**Overall the Work is divided as _Content_, which includes the Data and Documentation, and the underlying _Source-Code_ that transforms and displays that content.**

The **Content is licensed** under the [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 International] (CC-BY-SA 4.0), which allows for use and modification as long as you share the work under the same license and give credit to the original author of the work.
