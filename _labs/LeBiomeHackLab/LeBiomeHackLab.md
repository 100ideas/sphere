The Biome is an open community practicing biomimicry:

For 3.6 billion years nature evolves, innovates and adapts. We are inspired to improve together science and technology while respecting the environment and human.

The Biome gathers and mixes citizens, artists, entrepreneurs, researchers, do-it-yourselfers, local authorities, engineers, students ...

3 actions to do: projects, events and workshops

The projects we work on are documented and under free licenses to make them accessible and reusable.

We organize events with other communities and are accessible to as many people as possible to exchange, share and advance on different projects.

Nours organize workshops for biomimicry training
