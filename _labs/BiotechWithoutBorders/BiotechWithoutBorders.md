# About
Biotech Without Borders is a non-profit 501(c)(3) public charity dedicated to democratizing the practice of biotechnology for useful and peaceful purposes in order to benefit humankind and the planet. We believe that engaging the end users- all of us- in biotech through actual participation is the best way to ensure a greater future for us all.  Shouldn't something this valuable be practiced worldwide, by the most diverse array of practitioners? An important part of our mission is to enable the hands-on practice of biotechnology by communities, groups and countries hitherto underrepresented in the biotech landscape.
