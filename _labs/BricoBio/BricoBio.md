Like other maker or hacker spaces, our main goal is to make tools and knowledge for doing biology available and accessible to a wider community and general public. Our core values include:

Openness
Accessibility
Transparency
Community-focus
We are also sometimes known as biohackers and part of the Do-it-yourself Biology movement.
