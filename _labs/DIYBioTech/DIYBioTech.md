Let's meet to discuss our current work and future plans for collective experiments in DIY Biology, including, but not limited to: Growing bioluminescent plants, algae, fungi, bacteria, and what-have-you. (Growing non-glowing varieties of those things is also okay, but potentially less exciting.) What we need to do in order to participate in iGEM. DNA origami. Self quantification, including monitoring EEG, ECG, EMG, ETC. Building open hardware/wetware that makes all of the above feasible/more accessible. Let's also discuss other things that we might want to add to this list!
