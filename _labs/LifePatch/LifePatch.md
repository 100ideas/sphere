is a community-based cross-disciplinary organization formed on March 26, 2012. On the initiative of citizens in art, science and technology, Lifepatch invites Members and anyone involved in its activities to research, explore, and develop the presence of technology, natural resources, and human resources in the surrounding area. Citizen initiatives are chosen to provide a wider space for the diversity of member practices and spur the creativity of each member in a role in a collaborative activity. Do It Yourself (DIY) and Do It With Others (DIWO) is the passion that Lifepatch holds in practice in order to spur the emergence of new patterns and systems straightforwardly from individual and community creative processes, as well as interaction between individuals in the community work series.

Members of lifepatch have a mission to benefit in the development of local human and resource potentials, build domestic and international collaboration bridges, provide open access for anyone to the research resources and development outcomes. Lifepatch was founded on March 26, 2012 by several people with various background disciplines both from formal and non-formal education. Members who joined in lifepatch are domiciled in various cities such as Yogyakarta, Pekanbaru and Bogor. This is the main reason lifepatch initially moved by relying on communication over the internet.
