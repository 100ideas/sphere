La Paillasse is an open and citizen research laboratory where initiatives to initiate and accelerate scientific, entrepreneurial and artistic projects are carried out .

As an alternative to the world of academic research, La Paillasse places freedom of action , openness and transdisciplinarity at the heart of its values.
