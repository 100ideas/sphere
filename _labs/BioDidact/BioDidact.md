We are scientists and educators with a passion for science, learning and community outreach.

Biodidact is a Research and Development community lab with a mission to educate and serve our community by helping to make biotechnology education more accessible.

We offer various biotech workshops to students, schools, teachers and any other individual curious about biotechnology. Biodidact also helps students get a head start by giving them basic research experience opportunities and help them decide whether biotechnology is really something they want to do or not...(for more info on this topic click here).

Our mission: "Biotechnology education for all."
We are an independent research laboratory, committed to bringing life sciences to our community in a sustainable and responsible manner.
Biotechnology touches our everyday lives. Adequate biotechnology education is essential to our communities.
Better education= better decisions.
What benefit to our communities ?:
By making science more open, we believe that we will help our community get a better understanding of some of the technology that affects our everyday lives. It will also help students stay in science or even stay in school.
Hands-on learning can be the difference between staying in school or dropping out. Biodidact is also an opportunity for people (underemployed, or just curious) to learn new skills. We provide quality mentoring opportunities.

Benefits to the scientific community:
We believe that when a diverse group comes together...great things happen!
We do believe that "DIY Bio" and citizen science can play an integral part of not only the science education landscape, but also the basic scientific research culture.

In this era of decreased funding for basic science research, growing knowledge and creativity of both scientists and non-scientists, the community can come together and foster creative learning while collaborating with actual scientists and larger research institutions. We think that "citizen science" and "science crowdsourcing" are excellent ways to get our communities more involved and demystify science.

How can we expect our representatives to advocate more funding for basic scientific research if they, or their constituents, don't really grasp what is done in a lab?
