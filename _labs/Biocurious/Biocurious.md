## About
We are a complete working laboratory and technical library for entrepreneurs to cheaply access equipment, materials, and co-working space; a training center for biotechniques, with an emphasis on safety; a meeting place for citizen scientists, hobbyists, activists, and students

We believe that innovations in biology should be accessible, affordable, and open to everyone.
Weâ€™re building a community biology lab for amateurs, inventors, entrepreneurs, and anyone who wants to experiment with friends.

## History
BioCurious was co-founded by 6 entrepreneurs in 2010: Eri Gentry, Kristina Hathaway, Josh Perfetto, Raymond McCauley, Joseph Jackson, and Tito Jankowski. Countless other people helped BioCurious get off the ground in those early days, including 239 backers on Kickstarter, where we raised our original $35,319. See the BioCurious launch page on Kickstarter.
