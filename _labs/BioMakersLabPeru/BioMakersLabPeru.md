We are the first biohacker space in Peru. We seek to promote and develop biology, biotechnology and synthetic biology in a more accessible way for scientists, biohackers, amateurs or anyone which might be interested in these fields; in order to help local communities or the planet by creating new knowledge to the development of new products or environmentally responsible companies.â€‹
