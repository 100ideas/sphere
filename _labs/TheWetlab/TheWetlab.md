The Wet Lab is San Diegoâ€™s independent community of professional and citizen scientists brought together by our interest in using biology and biotechnology to make the world a better place. Through knowledge sharing, collaboration, and community engagement we aim to make scientific discovery accessible to everyone from all walks of life. We bring cutting edge discoveries to the public through our Citizen Science Lecture Series and hands-on Bio-Tech Workshops at the San Diego Public Library. Whether you are an independent researcher, biohacker, citizen scientist, or a curious member of the public, you will find something to interest you at The Wet Lab.
