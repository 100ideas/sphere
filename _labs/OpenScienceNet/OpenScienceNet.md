Welcome to Open Science Network, Vancouver’s first Community Biolab. We are a community of scientists, artists, makers, engineers, writers, tinkerers, hackers, citizen scientists, and professional scientists who have banded together to create an open community lab where we can gather to share ideas, knowledge, equipment, and opinions in a friendly and collaborative atmosphere.

Open Science Network is dedicated to supporting the pursuit of citizen science and democratized research. Our society shares a critical interest in the Science 2.0 movement, which we believe has the potential to work towards a more ethical, open and democratic model of scientific practice. We are participants in the DIYbio movement.

The OSN is interested in engaging anyone and everyone, no matter your science background – whether you are a scientist, writer, artist or just sci-curious and are interested in the practice of science at the local and global level. We are committed to providing a network that enables researchers to become educated and connected to the world of open hardware, wetware and science investigation.
