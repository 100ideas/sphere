Bionyfiken is a chartered non-profit organisation that brings together Sweden-based biohackers, DIY-
biologists, bodyhackers, grinders and quantified self-enthusiasts. We do not see these as different disciplines but rather parts of a spectrum of highly cross-fertilising technology driven movements.

Our objective is to be a driving force in the development of the dynamic and creative tech-activist movement in Sweden.

We arrange workshops, talks and experiments to educate and inspire the general public to improve their understanding of modern biotechnology, synthetic biology and various forms of bodyhacking.
