subtitle: At >top we reframe the laboratory as a shared space â€“ informal and inviting rather than sterile and exclusive. Through audience participation, the intention is to demystify biology and radically lower the barrier to participation in modern bioscience, allowing anyone to innovate and explore. Using borrowed, recycled and home-built equipment, 
we recreate a typical do-it- yourself biology (DIY bio) lab and bring biology to the public. This environment also encourages a thoughtful examination and discussion of the implications and ethical questions surrounding cutting-edge bio-based technologies.
