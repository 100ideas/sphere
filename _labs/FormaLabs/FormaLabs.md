Forma Labs exists to satisfy this curiosity, and to nurture it in a friendly, social environment into a passion for all things biology and beyond. As Irelandâ€™s first community laboratory, Forma Labs Biomakerspace provides equipment, space, and know-how through other members, allowing you to learn the art of DNA-barcoding and maybe finally answer that nagging question for yourself. Members and friends of Forma run events to introduce topics as diverse as DIY-neurobiology, bio-printing of human prosthetics, garage genetic sequencing or engineering, and food microbiology. Our monthly Bio Banter meetups appeal to people who just want casual chatter about science and technology. Our garden, kitchenette, co-working space and recreation room are there to provide a relaxed atmosphere for people who just want to chill out in good company. And, our learning-lab and donated or DIY equipment promises satisfaction to your burning science questions.
