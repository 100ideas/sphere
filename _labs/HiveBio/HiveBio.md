## About
HiveBio is a community supported Do-It-Yourself (DIY) biology laboratory located in Seattle, Washington. As a non-profit organization, HiveBio opened its doors to the Pacific Northwest DIYbio community in the second half of 2013. The purpose of this community-run lab is to give the currently scattered individuals of the Seattle DIYbio community a central hub to meet and share ideas, as well as provide an accessible and affordable lab space for members to carry out the research and experiments that they would not have the opportunity to do elsewhere.
