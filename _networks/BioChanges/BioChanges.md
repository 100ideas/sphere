# About
An international group of scientists, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs investigating emerging ideas, projects, and startup opportunities in BioDesign Innovation.

We assist in the development of advanced BioDesign startup companies, courses, and lab facilities through consultancy, events, and lab workshops.

Startup assistance and consultancy is available in bioengineering, 3D bioprinting, synthetic biology, biorobotics, microfluidics, regenerative medicine, and biomaterial/bioink applications.

Previous international events and workshops were hosted by Imperial College London, Royal College of Art, and the MIT Media Lab.
