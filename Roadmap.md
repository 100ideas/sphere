# Roadmap for DIYbiosphere

> The DIYbiosphere is a participatory project to create and maintain a database of worldwide DIYbio initiatives. Would you like to contribute? Check out our [Getting started] page and follow our [Contributing guidelines].

## Past
We keep track of past changes in our [CHANGELOG]. New releases are published as significant new features or changes have been made to the code and/or the design. The database is expected to be continuously updated.

## Present and Future
In this section we list the issues that we want to implement soon and in the near and not-so-near future. We aggregate them as [Milestones]. You can learn more about how we manage the development of our project and our issues in our [Issue management] section.
