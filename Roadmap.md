# Roadmap for DIYbiosphere
The DIYbiosphere is a participatory project to create and maintain a database of worldwide DIYbio initiatives. Would you like to contribute? Check out our [Getting started] page and follow our [Contributing guidelines].

In this section we list the issues that we want to implement soon and in the future. We list them as an indeterminate timeline; from short, medium, and long term. Within this timeline, we establish [Milestones] with specific deadlines we would like to reach. You can learn more about how we manage the development of our project and our issues in our [Issue management] section.

We keep track of past changes as we publish releases in our [CHANGELOG]. New releases are made as new features are added or changed and only refer to the code and the design since the database is expected to be continuously updated.

## Short term
_This is what we are working on right now_

### [Milestone: Minimal Viable Product]
Either before, or during, we would like to develop a MVP platform, that we can share with our contributor community. For now, it seems that one of the major needs for improvement is the documentation and the design. There are a lot of broken links that need to be filled in with information.


## Medium Term
_This is what we will work on next_

This is a list in no particular order of priority



## Long Term
_This is what we would like to work on eventually_

### Fully functional map
#### Static map
We want to create a fully functional map where you can select Earth, or a subregion and be able to see pinpoints of all the applicable

#### Dynamic map
Fully functional queries and filters and overlay tools that can let the user select what kind of initiative, from what period, and with what type of backing they want to visualize in the map.
For the networks, it would be nice to visualize these as linked initiatives.
