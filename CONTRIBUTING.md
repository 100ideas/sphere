# Contributing Guide
We :heartpulse: contributions! We really appreciate your interest in our project.

The following is a set of guidelines submiting [Issues] and [Pull requests].


Check out the [Getting Started] guide to learn how to _use_ and _contribute_ to the database. We also have an [ELI5 guide] (Explain like I'm 5) for the utterly GitHub confused!

# Issues
We use [GitHub Issues] to keep track of [bugs](#report-a-bug), [suggestions](#make-a-suggestion), [questions](#ask-a-question), [membership requests](#apply-for-membership), and so on. Go to our repository's [Issues tab] to submit one!

#### Before Submitting
Please consider the following before submitting a new issue:

- **Avoid making [duplicates](#removing-duplicates)**: Do a search on the project’s issues to check whether someone has submitted the same or a similar issue. You can :+1: to [vote](#adding-reactions) for an issue.
- **Follow general [style guides](#styleguides)**: Good titles and descriptions generate less questions and discussions and therefore create quicker responses and solutions.
- **[Classify](#issue-management) new issues**: Members are encouraged to apply [labels](#labels), [milestones](#milestones), and [boards](#boards) to their own issues and new issues from contributors.

## Report a bug
A bug :bug: is an error in the code that produces unexpected or undesired results. Bugs generally concern only the [coders] team. The following guidelines help them address the problem appropriately:

- Describe the problem and how you encountered it.
- Describe how it should work instead.
- Provide as much useful visual content as you can (screenshots and screencaptures).

## Make a suggestion
Whether it is a new feature or an enhancement to improve an existing feature, we really appreciate suggestions and ideas :gift_heart:. Please follow these guidelines:

- Describe as much as possible what your suggestion is
- Describe how it would work, or how it would look like
- Share examples and references and include links, images, GIFs, etc.

## Ask a question
You can submit a question as an issue if it concerns the DIYbiosphere project. You can also asks questions in our [Gitter] chatroom, in a [Slack] channel or direct message to a member in either platform.

Make sure to check out our [FAQs] for a list of common questions.

## Request membership
Submit a new issue with the Title: 'Requesting membership' and in the Comment section add a description of yourself and why you would like to join (optional but useful for those considering your application). Also, please specify if you would like to be added to a [Team]

As a member of the DIYbiosphere organization in GitHub, you have _write_ access to the repositories (learn more about [permission levels])

# Pull Requests
When you are ready to merge your work, submit a Pull Request (PR) for review :wink:

#### Before you submit a Pull Request
Please consider the following before submitting a new PR:
- **[Merge conflicts]()**: if you build locally, sync and merge conflicts if there are any.
- **Follow general [style guides](#styleguides)**: Good titles and descriptions generate less questions and discussions and therefore create quicker responses and solutions.
- **[Classify](#issue-management) new PRs**: Members are encouraged to apply [labels](#labels), [milestones](#milestones), and [boards](#boards) to their own PR and new PRs from contributors.


## Merging
If your PR does not check the Travis build DO NOT merge!. Check either in Travis or in Github, why it did not pass... make changes to your repository to fix these. Please also fix changes by hound. Commit these changes to your branch or fork. sync them. and wait for the checks to pass again!


# Styleguide
The code in our project is mainly HTML, SCSS, and JS, the two latter are checked by the [Hound] bot when.

## Commit message
The seven rules of a great git commit message:

1. Limit the title to 50 characters and do not end with a period
2. Use the comment section to explain what and why vs. how

# Management of Pull Requests and Issues
Issues and Pull Requests are classified and organized by [labels](#labels), [milestones](#milestones), [epics](#epics) and [boards](#boards). The two latter are features of [ZenHub] which we use for project management. It has native integration in GitHub and works for Chrome and Firefox ([Add ZenHub to GitHub]).

### Labels
Labels are for categorizing and filtering issues. The ones in place for now include:

### Epics
Epics provide a hierarchy to issues. They are a theme of work that contains several sub-tasks needed to complete the larger goal.
If estimate the issue will take weeks or months to finish, it should probably become an
If it is too complex, if several sub-tasks are required to mark it as done it should be an


### Milestones
Milestones act as container for issues or as events, or achievement goals. This is useful for associating issues with specific features or project phases. Milestones are groups of issues that correspond to a project, feature, or time period. Like Beta Launch, October, Sprint, Redesign.
Milestones are used to track the progress of similar issues and pull requests as they're opened and closed over time. At a glance, you can easily see the progress of work in a milestone's lifetime.

### Boards
In the Boards tab, we can see how issues are divided between:
- New issues: where uncategorised issues go to
- Discuss: are
- To Do:
- In Progress:
- Future:
- Done:
- Closed:
