### Submitting Issues
Please consider the following before submitting a new issue:
- **Avoid making duplicates**: Do a search on the project’s issues to check whether someone has submitted the same or a similar issue. If you would like to vote for an existent issue, please add the :+1: reaction ([ELI5 GIF]).
- ** Follow general style guides**: _Good_ tittles and descriptions generate less questions and discussions and therefore create quicker responses and solutions.
- ** Apply labels, milestones, and boards**:  If you are a member of the DIYbiosphere, you can apply all the previous features to your own issues and new issues from non-members

#### Report a bug
A bug is an error in the code that produces unexpected or undesired results. Bugs generally concern only the @coders team. The following guidelines help them address the problem appropriately.
- Describe how you encountered the problem
- Describe the behavior you observed
- Specify your operating system and the browser you are using
- If it is related to the build please specify what software you are using and what packages you have installed.
- Please provide as much (useful) visual content as you can. Attach screenshots or screengifs

You can use the [bug template] to make things easie

#### Make a suggestion
We really appreciate ideas to improve the project. Many times these can either be classified as a `new feature` or as an `enhancement` which is an improvement (small or large) to an already existing feature. Please follow these guidelines:
- Describe as much as possible what your suggestion is
- Describe how it would work, or how it would look like
- If applicable, share examples and references and include links, images, or GIFs.

#### Ask a question
It is possible to ask a question through the project’s GitHub issues. The question has to be concerning the DIYbiosphere project. Alternatively, you can ask a question on our [Gitter] chatroom, Join our team in [Slack] and pose the question on the channel you deem fit, or send us a [tweet] or [email].

#### Apply for membership
Submit a new issue with the title: “Applying for membership” and in the Comment section add a description of yourself and why you would like to join; this is optional but useful for those considering your application. After you receive the email invitation and you accept to join,  Close the issue with the comment of “accepted”

As a member of the DIYbiosphere organization in GitHub, you have _write_ access to the repositories (learn more about [permission levels])

### Issue management
Issues are organized by labels, milestones, boards
We use [ZenHub] for project/issues management. It has native integration in GitHub and works for Chrome and Firefox. [Add ZenHub to GitHub].


#### Labels
Labels are for categorizing and filtering your issues

#### Milestones
Milestones act as container for issues. This is useful for associating issues with specific features or project phases. Milestones are groups of issues that correspond to a project, feature, or time period.  Like Beta Launch, October, Sprint, Redesign.

#### ZenHub

##### Epics
Epics provide a hierarchy to issues. They are a theme of work that contains several sub-tasks needed to complete the larger goal
If estimate the issue will take weeks or months to finish, it should probably become an epix
If it is too complex, if several sub-tasks are required to mark it as done it should be an epix.


https://www.zenhub.io/blog/working-with-epics-in-github/

##### Boards
In the Boards tab, we can see how issues are divided between:
- New issues: where uncategorised issues go to
- Backlog: are

## Commits
To commit changes is to basically save the changes you made to the repository.
Committing changes will depend whether you do it through GitHub online GUI or the Desktop app which we recommend. Committing changes will be different depending on you [writing privileges].
-Direct commits
- Forking
- Branching

### Committing changes

## Pull Requests
Users with different access and push permissions to the repository and main branch will follow different steps

> **Note: Permission levels** <br>
> Users with different access and push permissions to the repository and main branch will follow different steps. Learn more about the [permission levels] of the project.

This guide assumes you have the most basic permission access to the repository.

Depending on your read/write permissions and your push access to the repository you can either `Commit directly to the master branch`, `Create a new branch and start a pull request`, or `Fork the project, write changes in a new branch in your fork, and send a pull request`. Coders and Designers may want to branch out or fork the repository depending on the contributions they want to do.

In order to run locally you have to use the terminal. If you have never used it, don’t worry! It is as easy as copy & paste.
The instructions and programs you need depend on your operating system (OSx, Windows, or Linux), pleas
