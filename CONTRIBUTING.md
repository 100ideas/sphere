# Contributing Guide
We really appreciate your interest in our project. We :heartpulse: contributions! By contributing, you agree to abide to our [Code of Conduct] and consent to our [Copyright Terms].

The following is a set of guidelines for submiting [Issues](#Submitting Issues) and [Pull requests](#Submitting Pull Requests), and for making [Commit messages](#Making Commits).

Check out the [Getting Started] guide to learn how to _use_ and _contribute_ to the database. We also have an [ELI5 guide] (Explain like I'm 5) for the utterly GitHub confused! See our [tutorials], like for [adding a new entry] or [editing an entry].

If you want to work locally, follow the [Installation Instructions]. We highly recommend it! It is much more pleasant to work with!  :heart_eyes: :computer:

# Submitting Issues
We use [GitHub Issues] to keep track of the development of the project. Go to our repository's [Issues tab] to submit one!

#### Before Submitting
Please consider the following before submitting a new issue:

- **Avoid making [duplicates]**: Do a search on the project’s issues to check whether someone has submitted the same or a similar issue. You can :+1: to [vote] for an issue.
- **[Organize] new issues**: Members are encouraged to apply [labels], [milestones], and [boards] to their own issues and new issues from contributors.

## Report a bug
A bug :bug: is an error that produces unexpected or undesired results. Follow these guidelines:

- Describe the problem and how you encountered it
- If appropriate, include your operating system and version, browser and version, other software, etc.
- Describe how it should work instead
- Provide as much useful visual content as you can ([screenshots] and [screencaptures])


## Make a suggestion
Have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement? We really appreciate suggestions! :gift_heart:. Please follow these guidelines:

- Describe as much as possible what your idea is
- Describe how it would work or how it would look like
- Share examples and references and include links, images, and GIFs.

## Ask a question
Please include a question mark `?` in the title of the Issue. You can also asks questions in our [Gitter chatroom], in our [Slack channels] or direct message to a member in either platform. You can freely enter the chatroom and you can [request an invite] to our Slack team.

## Request membership
Submit a new issue with the Title: 'Requesting membership' and in the Comment section add a description of yourself and why you would like to join (optional but useful for those considering your application). Also, please specify if you would like to be added to any [Teams].

# Making Commits
Good commits speed the reviewing process and facilitate tracking past changes. If you are making many changes that are unrelated, please split them into dedicated commits! Please follow these guidelines for your commits:

1. **subject line**: Describe the change and (if applicable and non obvious) why it was necessary. Use imperative (like 'Add' not 'Added'), Capitalize first letter, don't end with period, and limit to 50 characters. If the sentence has the word 'and' or lists more than one item, split the commit!
2. **message lines**: Answer _why_ the change was made and _how_. If addressing an Issue link to it!

# Submitting Pull Requests
When you are ready to merge your work, submit a Pull Request (PR) for review :wink:

#### Before you submit a Pull Request
Please consider the following before submitting a new PR:

- **Merge conflicts**: if you build locally, sync and merge conflicts if there are any.
- **[Classify](#issue-management) new PRs**: Members are encouraged to apply [labels](#labels), [milestones](#milestones), and [boards](#boards) to their own PR and new PRs from contributors.


## Merging
If your PR does not pass the Travis build DO NOT merge! Check either in Travis or in Github, why it did not pass... make changes to your repository to fix these. Please also fix changes by hound. Commit these changes to your branch or fork. sync them. and wait for the checks to pass again!
