## Issues
We use [GitHub Issues] to keep track of [bugs](#report-a-bug), [suggestions](#make-a-suggestion), [questions](#ask-a-question),  [membership requests](#apply-for-membership), and so on.

### Submitting Issues
Please consider the following before submitting a new issue:
- **Avoid making duplicates**: Do a search on the project’s issues to check whether someone has submitted the same or a similar issue. If you would like to vote for an existent issue, please add the :+1: reaction ([ELI5 GIF]).
- ** Follow general style guides**: _Good_ tittles and descriptions generate less questions and discussions and therefore create quicker responses and solutions.
- ** Apply labels, milestones, and boards**:  If you are a member of the DIYbiosphere, you can apply all the previous features to your own issues and new issues from non-members.

#### Report a bug
A bug is an error in the code that produces unexpected or undesired results. Bugs generally concern only the @coders team. The following guidelines help them address the problem appropriately.
- Describe how you encountered the problem
- Describe the behavior you observed
- Specify your operating system and the browser you are using
- If it is related to the build please specify what software you are using and what packages you have installed.
- Please provide as much (useful) visual content as you can. Attach screenshots or screengifs
