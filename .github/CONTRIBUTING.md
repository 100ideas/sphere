# Contributing Guide
We really appreciate your interest in our project. We :heartpulse: contributions! By contributing, you agree to abide to our [Code of Conduct] and consent to our [Copyright Terms].

The following is a set of guidelines for submiting [Issues](#Submitting-Issues) and [Pull requests](#Submitting-Pull-Requests), and for making [Commit messages](#Making-Commits).

## Submitting Issues
We use [Issues] to keep track of the development of the project. See our [Submit an Issue] tutorial for step-by-step instructions.

#### Before Submitting
Please consider the following before submitting a new issue:

- **Avoid making [duplicates]**: Do a search on the project’s issues to check whether someone has submitted the same or a similar issue. You can :+1: to [vote] for an issue, like an enhancement or a feature request.
- **[Organize] new issues**: Members are encouraged to apply [labels], [milestones], and [boards] to their own issues and new issues from contributors.

### Report a bug
A bug :bug: is an error that produces unexpected or undesired results. Follow these guidelines when submitting:

- Describe the problem and how you encountered it
- If appropriate, include your operating system and version, browser and version, other software, etc.
- Describe how it should work instead
- Provide as much useful visual content as you can ([screenshots] and [screencaptures])


### Make a suggestion
Share with us a suggestion for a new feature or an enhancement. Please follow these guidelines when submitting:

- Describe as much as possible what your idea is
- Describe how it would work or how it would look like
- Share examples and references and include links, images, and GIFs.

### Ask a question
Make sure that your title has a `?` question mark. You can also asks questions in our [Gitter chatroom], in our [Slack channels] or direct message to a member in either platform. You can freely enter the chatroom and you can [request an invite] to our Slack team.

Make sure to check out our [FAQs] for a list of common questions.

### Membership request
Submit a new issue with the Title: 'Membership request' and in the Comment section add a description of yourself and why you would like to join (optional but useful for those considering your application). Also, please specify if you would like to be added to any [Teams].

As a [member] of the [DIYbiosphere organization] in GitHub, you enjoy more access permissions to the project!


### Report a broken link
Didn't find the page you were looking for? If you know how to fix it, please go ahead and do so. If not, then please submit a new issue with the Title 'Broken link'. In the Comment section please:

- note the name of the page you were at before you encountered the 404 Error
- specify the name of the link you clicked that lead to the 404 page
- copy and paste the URL of the 404 Error page


## Making Commits
Good commits speed the reviewing process and facilitate tracking past changes. If you are making many changes that are unrelated, or your commit title has the word 'and', split the commits! Please follow these guidelines for your commit messages:

1. **Title**: Describe the change and why it was necessary. Use imperative (like 'Add' not 'Added'), Capitalize first letter, don't end with period, and limit to 50 characters.
2. **Comments**: Describe in further detail _why_ the change was made and _how_. If addressing an Issue link to it!


## Submitting Pull Requests
When you are ready to merge your work, submit a Pull Request (PR) for review of our fork or branch :wink: See our [submitting a pull request] tutorial for step-by-step instructions.

#### Before you submit a Pull Request
Please consider the following before submitting a new PR:

- **Merge conflicts**: conflicts are more common when working locally.
- **[Organize] new PRs**: Members are encouraged to apply [labels], [milestones], and [boards] to their own PR and new PRs from contributors.


### Merging
If your PR does not pass the Travis build DO NOT merge! Check either in Travis or in Github, why it did not pass... make changes to your repository to fix these. Please also fix changes by hound. Commit these changes to your branch or fork. sync them. and wait for the checks to pass again!
