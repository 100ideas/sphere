:tada: Welcome to the DIYbiophere repository :tada:

We really appreciate your interest in our project and we would :heart: your contributions! Please contact @sabgaby if you are interested in this project

> At the moment, we are working hard :sweat_smile: to develop a "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) as they say in the _techbiz_. Unfortunately we are in hiatus do to the main contributor finishing her PhD. Please help us by contributing so we can eventually share it with early adopters! :metal:

## About
[The DIYbiosphere] is a participatory project of Do-It-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world. The project is open for anyone to add and edit entries (writers), as well as to code, design, and shape the overall project (developers).

The goal is to have a shared and common platform that can connect people and ideas in all its possibilities and encourage the DIYbio community to work on a common project. With the open data we gather we plan to map and visualize the DIYbio community in all its diversity across time and space to learn more about the movement and its futures.

We have our own [entry] in the DIYbiosphere! Go check it out!

### How it works
The project functions similar to a wiki, but we use [GitHub Pages] to host and build webpages for the entries from [Markdown] text files. To learn more about the technical details, read the [software] section in the [documentation]
