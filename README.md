:tada: Welcome to the DIYbiophere repository :tada:

We really appreciate your interest in our project and we would :heart: your contributions!

> At the moment, we are working hard :sweat_smile: to develop a "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) as they say in the _techbiz_. Please help us by contributing so we can eventually share it with early adopters! :metal:

## About
[The DIYbiosphere] is a participatory project to create a library of Do-It-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world. The project is public; open for anyone to add and edit entries, as well as to shape the overall project. The goal is to have a shared and common platform that can connect people and ideas in all its possibilities. With the open data we gather we plan to map and visualize the DIYbio community in all its diversity across time and space in the hopes that we may learn more about the movement and its futures.

We have our own [entry] in the library! Go check it out!

### How it works
The library functions similar to a wiki. Each entry has it's own webpage with a written description and a box displaying some of the initiative's data. Instead of using the wiki software we use [GitHub Pages] to host and build the library from simple text files with [Markdown] syntax.

#### Contribute
