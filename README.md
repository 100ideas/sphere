We really appreciate your interest in our project :+1: and we would :heart: your contributions!

## About
The DIYbiosphere is a participatory project to create a database of Do-It-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world. The project is public; open for anyone to add and edit entries, as well as to shape the overall project. The goal is to have a shared and common _directory_ that can connect people and ideas in all its possibilities.

For more information about the project go to the [About] page and check out the project's [entry] in the database.

### How it works
The directory functions similar to a wiki, but we use [GitHub Pages] instead to host and build the content from simple text files using [Markdown] syntax.
