## About
A national gathering of leaders representing the breadth of the maker movement, the Nation of Makers Conference ("NOMCON") aims to spark and increase connections across sectors, generate robust collaborations, and promote the growth of an inclusive Nation of Makers. A central goal of the event is the promotion of relationship-building across lines of regular conversation, generating an increased sense of connected community throughout the entire ecosystem of maker-supporting entities.
