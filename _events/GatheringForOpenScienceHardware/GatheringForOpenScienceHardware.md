## About
Without hardware, there is no science. Instruments, reagents, computers, and lab equipment are the platforms for producing systematic knowledge. Yet, current supply chains limit access and impede creativity and customization through high mark-ups and proprietary designs. This can be compounded by private hardware licenses and patents. Open Science Hardware (OSH) addresses part of this problem by sharing designs, instructions for building, and protocols.

## Events
2019: May 17th is the first Great Lakes Gathering for Open Science Hardware in Toronto, Canada. http://openhardware.science/gatherings/great-lakes-gosh-2019/
