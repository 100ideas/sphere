## About
The Community Biotechnology Initiative at the MIT Media Lab is organizing a Global Summit on Community Biotechnology this fall from Friday September 22 to Sunday September 24. Our goal is to provide a space for the global community of bio-hackers and members of independent and community laboratories to convene, plan, build fellowship, and continue the evolution of our movement. Our programming topics will include: diversity and inclusion, sharing and learning, bio security, enabling technologies, bio art and design, and more.

We are asking all interested participants to apply! While all are welcome, space is limited, so we are prioritizing active practitioners in the community with an emphasis on diversity across geographic, cultural, ethnic, gender, and creative backgrounds. We will add accepted participants to the Directory on a rolling basis with the goal of accepting everyone interested in joining.

We are also organizing additional programming for those traveling from far on Thursday September 21 and Monday September 25.
