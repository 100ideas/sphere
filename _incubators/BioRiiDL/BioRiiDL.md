# About

BioRiiDL is the facilitating center for biotech startups as well as students across somaiya campus.
The mission of the this lab is to make science accessible to people of all ages and educational backgrounds. We do this by providing laboratory equipment and workspace, resources which are typically out of the reach of the amateur, to anyone passionate about learning. We put on classes geared towards beginners so anyone can join and we organize open meetup days where newcomers can mingle with veterans to exchange ideas. In addition, we allow members to use our common resources to work on their own research projects. We believe the combination of an open laboratory and cutting edge research projects makes for an exciting learning environment.
