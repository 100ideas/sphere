## About
Developing Lifesaving Antibiotics using the secret language of bacteria. 

Prospective Research, Inc. was founded with a vision to develop novel, lifesaving antibiotics.

70% of todays antibiotics come from soil microbes and yet less than 10% of the microbe's potential has been tapped.
Microbes have typically been cultured in isolation, removing them from the stimuli they need to produce their most potent antibiotics. 

Our MicrobeMinerâ„¢ platform mimics stimuli in the soil, giving us exclusive access to untapped antibiotics.
