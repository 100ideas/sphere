## About
Quantgene makes cancer a curable disease by using high-sensitivity diagnostics technology to detect tumor mutations in standard patient blood samples at very low concentrations. This enables to detect the 10 deadliest cancers in stage 1 and 2 rather than 3 and 4. Detecting cancer in stage 1 and 2 enables surgical removal of the tumors and avoids chemotherapy with significant effects on survival rates and costs. Early detection can reduce cancer deaths by up to 80% annually.

Quantgene is effective for lung, breast, colorectal, pancreatic, liver, ovarian and prostate cancer as well as for melanoma, leukemia, non-hodgkin and hodgkin lymphoma.
