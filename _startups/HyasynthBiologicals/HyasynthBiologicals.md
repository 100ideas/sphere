## About
Natural molecules or derivatives make up more than half of the current drugs on the market with applications to nearly every disease known to humans. Salicylic acid, morphine, cannabinoids and insulin are a few examples. Our specialty is in producing these, and new targets, using a fast and scalable platform based on engineered microbes.

We use the technologies from traditional and modern biology combined with computational analysis to develop our organisms at the fastest possible speed. This makes our platform faster and cheaper than chemical synthesis or extraction from the natural source.
