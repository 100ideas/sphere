# About
The food on our dinner plate has travelled on average 15.000 kilometres to get there. RotterZwam aims to shorten that. We use something that is considered ‘waste’ to grow delicious gourmet mushrooms. What is that ‘waste’ you might ask?

Coffee is after oil the most traded commodity in the world. And making coffee is a very inefficient process. Only 0,2% of the coffee bean ends in your cup. The other 99,8% is considered waste and thrown away. In The Netherlands alone we throw away an average of 120 million kilo of coffee waste. If you drink coffee, we can help you to grow mushrooms on it!
