## About
Folia Water is a wholesale technology manufacturer of paper filters: our business model is to sell large volumes of our Folia Filters™ to international consumer goods distributors who have the expertise and know-how to handle local distribution.  Folia aims to partner with commercial, entrepreneurial, and social enterprise distribution partners capable of handling marketing and localization including product positioning, messaging, supply chain, and last mile distribution.

Folia Water's target consumers are the 3 billion people in countries throughout the world who make between $2 and $10/day.  These low-income people collectively spend $20 billion on water, typically overpaying for bottled water or soda.  Folia Filters™ are designed to be affordable for low-income consumers around the world, providing these consumers with the agency to afford their own safe water. 

Our vision is for our Folia Filters™ to be sold as a staple in retail stores throughout low and middle income countries.
