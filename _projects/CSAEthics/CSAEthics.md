The [Ethics Working Group](https://www.citizenscience.org/association/about/working-groups/ethics-working-group/) of the [Citizen Science Association](https://www.citizenscience.org) is maintaining a [collection of tools](https://www.citizenscience.org/association/about/working-groups/ethics-working-group/resources/ ) that all scientists--including citizen scientists and biohackers--can use for ethics. So far it includes:

* Codes of Ethics
* Consent Form Templates
* Recorded CSA Webinars (Ethics 101, Stakeholder Analysis, Transparency, Independent Review...)
* Other Training
* Guides
* Technologies
* Related Sites and and Blogs

Especially relevant to DIYbio, the collection includes tools to ["fork" your own ethics review committee](https://osf.io/gyxka/wiki/Initial%20Formation%20of%20a%20Committee/) (and register it as an IRB). Please share your own ethics innovations and utilize the tools developed by others.
