The DIYbiosphere is an open-source project to collect Do-It-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world. One of it's main purpose is to replace the list of DIYbio labs indexed in the [Local] section in the [DIYbio] website.

### To contribute
Edit or add your own DIYbio initiative to the repository.


# Mission
The goal is to have a common space where the DIYbio community can share about who and where they are and what they are doing. We believe that a centralized directory could benefit the DIYbio community by increasing visibility to projects, organizations and events. We hope that by connecting people and ideas, they may inspire, learn, and collaborate with each other. Additionally, the project can also serve as a reference point for DIYbio supporters and followers, including journalists, scholars, governmental agencies, and more.


# History
The DIYbiosphere was created by Gabriela A. Sanchez (@sabgaby), a PhD student at the University of Geneva, whose research focus is the DIYbio community. The project was proposed as an alternative mode to gather, access, and share information about DIYbio initiatives in a way that positively contributes useful resources back to the community.
