## About

The DIYbiosphere is a collaborative project to create an editable website to access and update a database of Do-it-Yourseld Biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world.

The project is for the DIYbio community, to serve as a common space where they can share about who they are, where, and what they do and why. The database can also serve as a reference point to DIYbio supporters and followers, including journalists, scholars, and governamental agencies.

The idea behind the DIYbiosphere is that a centralized platform could benefit the DIYbio community by encouraging potential collaborations and by learning about and from each other.

The data of the DIYbio initiatives is stored as plain text files in Markdown format (`.md`). The configuration imitates the functionality of the 'wiki technology' but instead uses GitHub Pages + Jekyll to build the static website from the `.md` files and host it on GitHub as a public repository.

The project is expected to unite the DIYbio community and to increase visibility to projects and organizations around the world.

## Origins
The DIYbiosphere was founded by Gabriela Sanchez (sabgaby), a PhD student at the University of Geneva, whose research focus is the DIYbio community. The project was proposed as an alternative mode to gather, access, and share information about DIYbio initiatives in a way that positively contributes useful resources back to the community.
