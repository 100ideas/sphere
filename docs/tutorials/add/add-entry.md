{% include tabs/add-entry-tabs.md %}



1. **Download <a class="noelink" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIYbiosphere/sphere/master/docs/EntryTemplate.md" download>entry template</a>**. The entry template has all the possible data fields you could add to an initiative. Learn more about [data fields], or download the <a class="noelink" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIYbiosphere/sphere/master/docs/EntryExample.md" download>entry example</a> as a guide and [view the render].
2. **Edit your file**. Open and edit the markdown file (.md file extension) in any text editor. We recommend [Atom].
3. **Save your file**. When you are done and ready to upload, rename the file with the initiative's name in camel case and no spaces: `TheInitiativeName.md`.
4. **Fork the repository**. As a non-member, you need to go to the [sphere] repository and click "Fork".
5. **Upload file**. In your forked copy (YourUsername/sphere), open the Collection folder of your new entry and click "Upload files", then select your entry file to upload
6. **Commit changes**. In the Subject line write "Initiative Name"
7. **Submit pull request (PR)**. In the subject line write "Add new entry: [InitiativeName]" and in the comments specify if it's your entry or not, and if a manager has been established.
8. **Wait for Merge**. A member will revise your PR, request additional commits from you or approve the PR and merge your changes to the original library.

**Rejoice!** your entry is now part of the DIYbiosphere library! :clap: :clap:

Thank you for your contribution! :heart:
