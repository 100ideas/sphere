title: Ticket Workflow
---

Members of the [Development Community][community] have the **responsability** to organize tickets to facilitate the collective workflow of the development of the project. Tickets are classified and organized by [Labels](#labels), [Projects](#projects) and [Milestones](#milestones)
See our [Contributing Guide] for submitting Issues and PRs and for writing good commit messages.

## Labels
Labels are for categorizing and filtering tickets. The following labels are currently in place:
- {% include label/bug.html %} are errors, undesired results or behaviors
- {% include label/critical.html %} are high-priority tickets
- {% include label/entries.html %} pertain to content and data
- {% include label/design.html %} pertain to the design
- {% include label/software.html %} pertain to the development of the code
- {% include label/docs.html %} pertain to the documentation
- {% include label/easy.html %} are relatively simple, or for beginner contributors
- {% include label/enhancement.html %} are incremental or gradual improvements
- {% include label/feature.html %} are new attributes, characteristics or functions
- {% include label/feedback.html %} are tickets that need opinions and comments
- {% include label/help.html %} are tickets that need other users to attend to
- {% include label/question.html %} are questions that need answers
- {% include label/resolution.html %} are tickets that need to be resolved soon

{% include info.html title="Labels can be for PRs" text="Labels will be applied mostly to Issues. However, when PRs require review or encounter problems in merging, labels may be applied to indicate any additional information (like 'critical', 'help wanted')." %}

## Projects
Projects help manage tickets in a KANBAN style using workflow columns and cards that can point to Issues, Pull Requests, or text notes. The ones we have now are:

- [Development Board][gh_project-development]: A playground, sandbox for developing and discussing ideas.
- [Find and Map entries][gh_project-search]: Basic functionality to search, find, map, and display entries
- [User interface and Help][gh_project-ui]: Documentation, design, everything that has to do with the usability of the website

## Milestones
Milestones track the progress of the development through the opening and closing of tickets. Milestones are useful for associating tickets with specific features, project. Milestones should be documented in the project's Changelog file

- [Minimum Viable Product][gh_milestone-mvp]:
- [Launch Party!][gh_milestone-launch]:
