The DIYbiosphere is an open-source project to collect Do-It-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world. One of it's main purpose is to replace the list of DIYbio labs indexed in the [Local] section in the [DIYbio] website.


The platform functions similarly to a wiki, with descriptive content and data displayed in a box. Instead of using the wiki software we use GitHub Pages, which allows for a more flexible and open development, and has the benefit of using simple text files in Markdown syntax for writing the entries. If you want to get technical your can read more in our [Software] section.

The development of the project is directed by members of the [development community]. Get involved and [Join us][join]! :metal: However, the project is completely open(-source)\*: anyone can (re)use the library on our website at [sphere.diybio.org][sphere], and contribute to it in our repository at [DIYbiosphere/sphere][gh_repo] on GitHub. Users of the platform can search for DIYbio initiatives; to learn about/from them, or connect with them. Contributors can [add] an entry for their own initiative or another you know of, [edit] an existing entry, or even tackle one of our [issues][gh_issues].

See our [Getting Started]  guide to kickstart you into _using_ and _contributing_ to the project. See our [Contributing Guide] for how to submit issues, and pull-requests. We also have have an [ELI5 guide] (Explain Like I'm 5) for the utterly confused.
