This is the Documentation, or docs, part of the project where you can find all the information pertaining to the DIYbiosphere project.

You have already started in the [**Introduction**][introduction] section. Here you can get a general [Overview] of the DIYbiosphere project and our [Getting Started][starting] guide to using and contributing to the database.

Learn more about the [Development Community][community] and [Organization][organization] behind the DIYbiosphere project in the [**About Us**][about] section. You can also learn about our external and internal [Communication][communication] channels.

Next, you should review our [**Copyright**][copyright] for the project. Users of the database should understand the (re)use and sharing rights attributed by our [License][license] and contributors of the project should be aware and agree to the [copyright of contributions][cla].

In [**The Basics**][basics] section we describe the "blueprints" of the project in reference to its four kind of works: the [Database][database], the [Development][development] (the software), the [Documentation][documentation], and the [Design][design].

The first principals for contributing and collaborating on the project are laid out in our [**Support**][support] section.

Our [ELI5 guide][eli5] (Explain Like I'm 5) is great for newbies and for the utterly confused.

The [**Resources**][resources] section stores all the references and cheat-sheets for working on the project. Reference back to the [Glossary][glossary] of the project or to follow the syntax for writing in [Markdown][md_syntax] and [Jekyll][jekyll_syntax].

Finally, go to the [**News**][news] section. This should be the most dynamic section of the Documentation as it is continuously updates the [Changelog][changelog] (the past) and the [Roadmap][roadmap] (the future) of the project. We have a small [Blog][blog] where we contributors share their experience and thoughts on the project.
