The Entries are the core of the DIYbiosphere project. The key ideas are:

- **[Collections]:** entries are divided into: _Projects_, _Startups_, _Labs_, _Incubators_, _Groups_, _Networks_, _Events_, and _Others_.
- **[Types of organizations][type-org]:** initiatives are classified under a 'category' that describes the organizational structure of the initiative: _Community/Grassroots_, _Primary/Secondary School_, _University/College_, _Non-Profit/NGO_, _For-Profit_, _Museum_, _State/Local Government_, and _Other_.
- **[Anatomy of an Entry][anatomy]:** entries display narrative text which describes the intiative (history, mission) and data contained in an infobox (location, founding date). Learn more about the [Data Fields][fields].

For an example, check the entry for the [DIYbiosphere project][e_sphere]! :wink:

## Using the Library
Users can access the entries of the library at: [sphere.diybio.org][sphere]. To find an entry use the _Search Bar_, you can search by name or location (city, countries). To look at a _List of Entries_ select 'All Entries', or select a specific collection from the 'Library' dropdown menu. In the list of entries page, you can further search for an entry by name or location, or you can use the buttons to refine and sort the results, including how they are displayed (table, grid, or map).

### Downloading the Dataset
In the List of Entries page, users can download a CSV file of the results shown. The entire dataset can be downloaded in the release page.
