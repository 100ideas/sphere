summary: On using the library and contributing to the project of the DIYbiosphere
---

The DIYbiosphere is a collaborative project to create a worldwide library of DIYbio initiatives.
The library is the core of the DIYbiosphere project. It's structure, components and organization are explained in detail in the [Basics of the Library][library] section. The key ideas are:

- **[Entry Collections][collections]:** entries are divided into: _Projects_, _Startups_, _Labs_, _Incubators_, _Groups_, _Networks_, _Events_, and _Others_.
- **[Types of organizations][type-org]:** initiatives are classified under a 'category' that describes the organizational structure of the initiative: _Community/Grassroots_, _Primary/Secondary School_, _University/College_, _Non-Profit/NGO_, _For-Profit_, _Museum_, _State/Local Government_, and _Other_.
- **[Anatomy of an Entry][anatomy]:** entries display narrative text which describes the intiative (history, mission) and data contained in an infobox (location, founding date). Learn more about the [Data Fields][fields].

For an example, check the entry for the [DIYbiosphere project][e_sphere]! :wink:

## Using the Library
Users can access the entries of the library at: [sphere.diybio.org][sphere]. To find an entry use the _Search Bar_, you can search by name or location (city, countries). To look at a _List of Entries_ select 'All Entries', or select a specific collection from the 'Library' dropdown menu. In the list of entries page, you can further search for an entry by name or location, or you can use the buttons to refine and sort the results, including how they are displayed (table, grid, or map).

### Downloading the Dataset
In the List of Entries page, users can download a CSV file of the results shown. The entire dataset can be downloaded in the release page.

## Contributing to the Library
The **only requirement** you need to contribute is a GitHub account ([sign up][gh_sign]). If you are new to GitHub check the [ELI5 guide] (Explain like I'm 5), made especially for the utterly confused. :smile:

Contribute to the library by [adding][add] a new entry, or [editing/updating][edit] an existing one. Follow our tutorials! The steps differ depending on your [access level][permissions].

## Contributing to the Development
The development of the project is organized through GitHub's [Issues][gh_issues]. Sort through the labels to find something that interests you. To contribute you can:

  - **Submit a new issue**: with your [complaint][s_bug], [question][s_question], [idea][s_suggestion] and wait for feedback and support from the [development community].
  - **Comment, answer, and vote**: search our issues and see if you can help out by moving our issues along: answer a {% include label/question.html %}, :+1: [vote][voting] on a {% include label/feature.html %} or {% include label/enhancement.html %}, participate in {% include label/feedback.html %}, assist on {% include label/resolution.html %} issues!
  - **Fork, commit, pull request** your contributions! Tackle {% include label/easy.html %} or {% include label/critical.html %} issues or assist on {% include label/help.html %} by someone on their request or idea.

Please follow our [Contributing Guide]. If you are a member, please help by moving issues along our [Workflow] assigning labels and so on to tickets. :kissing_smiling_eyes:
