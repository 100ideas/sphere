summary: Get familiar with using the library and contributing to the project of the DIYbiosphere
---

The DIYbiosphere is a collaborative project to create a worldwide library of DIYbio initiatives.
The library is the core of the DIYbiosphere project. It's structure, components and organization are explained in the [Basics of the Library][library] section. The key ideas are:

- **[Entry Collections][collections]:** entries are divided into: _Projects_, _Startups_, _Labs_, _Incubators_, _Groups_, _Networks_, _Events_, and _Others_.
- **[Organizational Categories][categories]:** initiatives are classified under a 'category' of organizational structure: _Community/Grassroots_, _Primary/Secondary School_, _University/College_, _Non-Profit/NGO_, _For-Profit_, _Museum_, _State/Local Government_, and _Other_.
- **[Anatomy of an Entry][anatomy]:** entries display narrative text which describes the intiative (history, mission) and data contained in an infobox (location, founding date). Learn more about the [Data Fields][fields].

For an example, check the entry on the [DIYbiosphere][e_sphere]! :wink:

## Using the Library
Users can access the entries of the library at: [sphere.diybio.org][sphere]. To search the whole library, use the _Search Bar_ located in the home page and in the top navigation bar. You can search by name or by location.
The _Search Query_ will return a _List of Entries_ with matching entries. To refine the search, use the search, filter and sort buttons.

### Downloading the Dataset
In the List of Entries, users can download a CSV file of the results shown. The entire dataset can be downloaded in the release page.

## Contributing to the Library
The **only requirement** you need to contribute is a GitHub account ([sign up][gh_sign]). If you are new to GitHub check the [ELI5 guide][eli5] (Explain like I'm 5), made especially for the utterly confused. :smile:

{% include warning.html title="By contributing you agree to:" text="Abide by our [Code of Conduct][coc], and consent to our [Contributor Terms][contributor-terms]" %}

Contribute to the library by [adding][add] a new entry, or [editing/updating][edit] an existing one. Follow our tutorials! The steps differ depending on your [access level][permissions].

## Contributing to the Development
The development of the project is organized through GitHub's [Issues][gh_issues]. Sort through the labels to find something that interests you. To contribute you can:

  - **Submit a new issue**: with your [complaint][s_bug], [question][s_question], [idea][s_suggestion] and wait for feedback and support from the [development community][community].
  - **Comment, answer, and vote**: search our issues and see if you can help out by moving our issues along: answer a [question][gh_question], :+1: [vote][voting] on a [feature][gh_feature] or [enhancement][gh_enhancement], participate in [feedback][gh_feedback], assist in [resolving][gh_resolution] issues!
  - **Fork, commit, pull request** your contributions! Tackle [easy][gh_easy] or [critical][gh_critical] issues or see if you can [help][gh_help] someone on their request or idea.

Please follow our [Contributing guidelines][contributing]. If you are a member, please help by moving issues along our [Workflow][workflow] assigning labels and so on to tickets. :kissing_smiling_eyes:
