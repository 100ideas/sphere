summary: In this section

_In this section we give a general overview of the entire project_

The DIYbiosphere is a participatory project to create a **database** of Do-It-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world. It has two main goals. One is to have a shared and common platform for the DIYbio community; to increase visibility of initiatives and connect people and ideas in all its possibilities. And two is to gather data about the DIYbio community; to map and visualize it in all its diversity across time and space in the hopes that we may learn more about the movement and its futures.

The database replaces the simple list of DIYbio labs indexed in the [Local] section in the [DIYbio][diybio] website as a more accurate and distributed way of cataloguing DIYbio labs and other initiatives. The database is intended to function similarly to a wiki, with descriptive content and data displayed in a box. Instead of using the wiki software we use GitHub Pages, which allows for a more flexible and open development, and has the benefit of using simple text files in Markdown syntax for writing the entries. If you want to get technical your can read more in our [Development][development] section.

The development of the project is directed by members of the [development community][community]. Get involved and [Join us][join]! :dancers: However, the project is completely open(-source)\*, anyone can access the database on our website: [sphere.diybio.org][sphere], and contribute to it in our repository: [DIYbiosphere/sphere][gh_repo] on GitHub. Users of the database can search for DIYbio initiatives; to learn about/from them, or connect with them. Contributors can [add][add] an entry for your own initiative or another you know of, [edit][edit] an existing entry, or even tacklr one of our [issues][gh_issues].

See our [Getting Started][starting] guide to kickstart you into _using_ and _contributing_ to the project. See our [Contributing Guide][contributing] for how to submit issues, and pull-requests. We also have have an [ELI5 guide][eli5] (Explain Like I'm 5) for the utterly confused.
