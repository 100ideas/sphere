_This is the kickstart guide to getting familiar with **using** the database, and **contributing** to the project of the DIYbiosphere. For a more general introduction of the project see our [Overview]_



The Database refers to all the information gathered on DIYbio initiatives; it is the core of the DIYbiosphere project. It's structure, components and organization are explained in the [Basics of the Database] section. The key ideas are:

- **[Entry Collections]:** entries are divided into: _Projects_, _Startups_, _Labs_, _Incubators_, _Groups_, _Networks_, _Events_, and _Others_.
- **[Typology of Initiatives]:** initiatives are categorized under a 'type' of organization: _Community/Grassroots_, _Primary/Secondary School_, _University/College_, _Non-Profit/NGO_, _For-Profit_, _Museum_, _State/Local Government_, and _Other_.
- **[Anatomy of an Entry]:** entries display narrative text which describes the intiative (history, mission) and data contained in an infobox (location, founding date). Learn more about the [Data Fields].

## Using the Database
Users can access the entries of the database at: [sphere.diybio.org]. To search the whole database, use the _Search Bar_ located in the home page and in the top navigation bar (it expands once clicked). Use keywords such as 'Lab', 'Geneva', 'Bioscope'.
To refine the search, press the button to use the _Advanced Search_ with predetermined filters.
