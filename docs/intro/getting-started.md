_This is the kickstart guide to getting familiar with **using** the database, and **contributing** to the project of the DIYbiosphere. For a more general introduction of the project see our [Overview]_


The Database is the core of the DIYbiosphere project. It refers to all the information gathered on DIYbio initatives. It's structure, components and organization are explained in the [Basics of the Database] section. The key ideas are:

- **[Entry Collections]:** entries are divided into: _Projects_, _Startups_, _Labs_, _Incubators_, _Groups_, _Networks_, _Events_, and _Others_.
- **[Typology of Initiatives]:** initiatives are categorized under a 'type' of organization: _Community/Grassroots_, _Primary/Secondary School_, _University/College_, _Non-Profit/NGO_, _For-Profit_, _Museum_, _State/Local Government_, and _Other_.
- **[Anatomy of an Entry]:** entries display narrative text which describes the intiative (history, mission) and data contained in an infobox (location, founding date). Learn more about the [data fields].

> Tip: Hover over icons for explanation
> The icons in the infobox display a simple description of its meaning:

## Using the Database
You can access the entries at: [sphere.diybio.org]. In the home page you can directly search for entries with keywords (i.e. Lab, Geneva, Bioscope) or do an Advanced Search with predetermined filters. Your Search Query will return a Table of Entries that match your search query. You can further search, filter and sort the table.

## Contributing to the Database
The **only requirement** you need to contribute is a GitHub account ([sign up]). If you are new to GitHub check the [ELI5 guide] (Explain like I'm 5), made especially for the utterly confused. :smile:

{% include _notices/note.html title="By contributing you agree to..." text="Abide by our [Code of Conduct](/about/coc/), and consent to our [Copyright terms](/about/license/)." %}

### _What_ can you contribute to?
There are four types of work in the project:

- **Database**: is the entries of the DIYbio initiatives. These are plain text files in Markdown. No skills required to contribute! Learn how [simple markdown] really is!
- **Documentation**: or **docs**, is all the explanatory material related to the project (like guides and tutorials). These are also plain text files.
- **Development**: is the code that converts the text files into data and a readable website. Coding skills are helpful.
- **Design** is all about the user experience, the aesthetics and interface of the website. Design skills recommended.

To learn more about how these works are structured, go to the [Basics] section. To directly contribute, go to our Issues tab and search f

### _How_ do you contribute
There are many ways you can contribute to the project. Please follow our [Contributing guidelines]. We organize the development of the project with [Issues]:

  - **Submit a a new issue**: with your [complaint], [question], [idea]. Someone from the development community will hopefully pick it up soon!
  - **Comment, answer, and vote**: See how you can help out by moving our issues along: answer a [question], [vote] on a feature or enhancement, give back [feedback], assist in [resolving] issues!
  - **Fork, commit, pull request** your contributions! Tackle [easy] or [critical] issues or see if you can [help] someone on their request.

### Want to get more involved?
[Join our development community!] We maintain a more active discussion and conversation on our [Slack Team], [Request an invite!].
