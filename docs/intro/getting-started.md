_This is the kickstart guide to getting familiar with **using** the database, and **contributing** to the project of the DIYbiosphere. For a more general introduction of the project see our [Overview][overview]_


The DIYbiosphere is a collaborative project to create a worldwide Database of DIYbio initiatives.
The Database is the core of the DIYbiosphere project. It's structure, components and organization are explained in the [Basics of the Database][database] section. The key ideas are:

- **[Entry Collections][collections]:** entries are divided into: _Projects_, _Startups_, _Labs_, _Incubators_, _Groups_, _Networks_, _Events_, and _Others_.
- **[Typology of Initiatives][typology]:** initiatives are categorized under a 'type' of organization: _Community/Grassroots_, _Primary/Secondary School_, _University/College_, _Non-Profit/NGO_, _For-Profit_, _Museum_, _State/Local Government_, and _Other_.
- **[Anatomy of an Entry][anatomy]:** entries display narrative text which describes the intiative (history, mission) and data contained in an infobox (location, founding date). Learn more about the [Data Fields][fields].

For an example, check the database' entry on the [DIYbiosphere][e_sphere]! :wink:

## Using the Database
Users can access the entries of the database at: [sphere.diybio.org][sphere]. To search the whole database, use the _Search Bar_ located in the home page and in the top navigation bar (it expands once clicked). Use keywords such as 'Lab', 'Geneva', 'Bioscope'.
To refine the search, press the button to use the _Advanced Search_ with predetermined filters.
<!--TODO: add GIF -->
The _Search Query_ will return a _Table of Entries_ with matching entries. To refine the search, use the search, filter and sort buttons.

### Downloading the Dataset
In the Table of Entries, users can download a CSV file of the results shown. The entire dataset can be downloaded in the release page.

## Contributing to the Database
The **only requirement** you need to contribute is a GitHub account ([sign up][gh_sign]). If you are new to GitHub check the [ELI5 guide][eli5] (Explain like I'm 5), made especially for the utterly confused. :smile:

{% include _notices/warning.html title="By contributing you agree to:" text="Abide by our [Code of Conduct][coc], and consent to our [Copyright terms][license]" %}

Contribute to the database by [adding][add] a new entry, or [editing/updating][edit] an existing one. Follow our tutorials! The steps differ depending on your [access level][permissions].

## Contributing to the Development
The development of the project is organized through GitHub's [Issues][gh_issues], Sort through the labels to find something that interests you. To contribute you can:

  - **Submit a new issue**: with your [complaint][s_bug], [question][s_question], [idea][s_suggestion] and wait for feedback and support from the [development community][community].
  - **Comment, answer, and vote**: search our issues and see if you can help out by moving our issues along: answer a [question][gh_question], :+1: [vote][voting] on a [feature][gh_feature] or [enhancement][gh_enhancement], participate in [feedback][gh_feedback], assist in [resolving][gh_resolution] issues!
  - **Fork, commit, pull request** your contributions! Tackle [easy][gh_easy] or [critical][gh_critical] issues or see if you can [help][gh_help] someone on their request or idea.

Please follow our [Contributing guidelines][contributing]. If you are a member, please help by moving issues along our [Workflow][workflow] assigning labels and so on to tickets. :kissing_smiling_eyes:
