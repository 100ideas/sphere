1. In your [master branch] of the repository, open the _database folder and choose a class folder for your new entry and **Create new file** named 'EntryName-ZZ.md'. Learn more about our [classification of entries] and [naming convention].
2. **Copy and paste [entry template]**
3. **Fill in your entry**
4. Save directly your changes to the repository and  **Commit changes** In th subject line write "Add new entry: [InitiativeName]" and in the comments specify if it's your entry or not, and if a manager (contact user for that entry) has been established.

**Rejoice!** your entry is now part of the DIYbiosphere database! :clap: :clap:
