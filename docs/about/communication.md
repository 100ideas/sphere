_In this section we lay out the different communication platforms the [development community][community] uses._



#### {% svgicon oi-issue-opened %} Github Issues
Submit a new issue to our repository's [Issues][hg_issues] tab with a [question][s_question], [suggestion][s_suggestion], or a [request to join][join] as a member. Members can mention users (like @ahuacatl) and [teams][teams] (learn more about [membership][members]. It should go without saying, but you need a GitHub account for this.

#### {% svgicon gitter %} Gitter
Is a chat service that integrates with GitHub. You can freely join the chatroom: [gitter.im/DIYbiosphere/sphere][gitter] for the repository. With Gitter, you can send a direct message (DM) to users in the chatroom; they have the same username as GitHub.

#### {% svgicon slack %} Slack
Is a very popular communication platform that offers integration with other services including GitHub notifications. We have our own Slack: [DIYbiosphere.slack.com][slack]. You have to [request an invite][invite], which you receive by email. You will instantly join all the channels, but you can leave or mute them.  Post your message in a channel or DM other users.
