title: Communication
summary: The different external and internal communication platforms the development community uses
---

As part of our [values][values] we strive to maintain our communication as public as possible. The DIYbiosphere has internal and external communication platforms. Internal refers to communication that concerns the project and its development (github, gitter, and slack), our external outlets are where we share the status of our project (twitter and blog).

#### Github Issues
We use GitHub's Issues to organize and manage the development of the project, and it is here where the majority of conversations relating to the project should happen. The [Issues][gh_issues] are public, but in order to submit a new issue you need a [GitHub account][gh_sign]. You can submit a [question][s_question], [suggestion][s_suggestion], or a [request to join][join] the [development communtiy][community].

#### Gitter
[Gitter] is a chat service. So far, we have a public chatroom for the sphere repository at [gitter.im/DIYbiosphere/sphere][gitter], and a chatroom for the DIYbiosphere Organization at [gitter.im/DIYbiosphere/](https://gitter.im/DIYbiosphere?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) where only members can join. There repo chatroom is integrated into the website and can be accesed.

#### Slack
Is a very popular communication platform that offers integration with other services including GitHub notifications. We have our own Slack: [DIYbiosphere.slack.com][slack]. You have to [request an invite][invite], which you receive by email. You will instantly join all the channels, but you can leave or mute them.  Post your message in a channel or DM other users.


##### Gitter vs Slack
For the moment, there is no preference on what communication platform will be used more often. As the project gains members and contributors, the most popular communication platform will win.

#### Twitter
As many other organizations, we also have a twitter. For the moment it is somewhat inactive during alpha release. Once we go to beta release we will set up some automatic tweets for every new entry added to the library.

#### Blog
The Blog is intended for the humans in the project. For the contributors to be able to share their experiences, what they like or don't and what they have learned on the project. It will start after beta release.
