title: Overview of the DIYbiosphere
---

In this section we give a general overview of the entire project by answering some questions.

**_What is it?_**
The DIYbiosphere is a participatory project to create a database of Do-It-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world.

**_Who participates?_**
The project is completely open; anyone can contribute with writing entries or to the development of the project. The work is created by volunteer contributors and managed by members of the [DIYbiosphere organization] in GitHub. [Join us!] :dancers:

**_Why do it?_**
The goal is two-fold: one is to have a shared and common platform for the DIYbio community, that can connect people and ideas in all its possibilities, and two is to gather data about the DIYbio community, to map and visualize it in all its diversity across time and space in the hopes that we may learn more about the movement and its futures.

**_How can I use this?_**
You can search for DIYbio initiatives; learn about/from them, or connect with them. You can also [add an entry] your own initiative or another you know of.


**_How does it works?_**
The database functions similar to a wiki, with descriptive content and data displayed in a box, but we use [GitHub Pages] instead to host and build the content into the website from simple text files using [Markdown] syntax and [Jekyll]'s liquid language. If you want to get technical your can read more in our [Build] section.

**_How is it organized?_**
The database is divided in eight classes of entries: Projects, Startups, Labs, Incubators, Groups, Networks, Events, and Others. Although we think they are self-explanatory, you can review our [class definitions].

**_Where can I learn more?_**
You are in the _Documentation_ section (look to the left side bar). Here you can learn more [About] the project; how it's managed, and developed. Check out our [News] for how the development of the project is going, and how it has changed. And see our [Help] section to learn how the basic components were designed, how you can contribute, tutorials, etc.

**Where do I start?**
The [Getting Started] is the perfect place to start, it details how to use the database (explaining its structure and navigation), how to obtain the dataset, and hiw to contribute to it. You just want to add an entry follow our [Adding an entry] tutorial. You can also check out our
