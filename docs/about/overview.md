# Overview to the DIYbiosphere
DIYbiosphere is _essentially_ an open directory of Do-It-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world. The idea behind the project is to have a (somewhat) centralized and (kind of) standardized platform that can increase awareness of DIYbio people and ideas wherever they are or come from. The database of these initiatives is intended to be maintained volunteer contributors and managed by the [DIYbiosphere Organization]. Go to our [Organization] page to learn more about how the project is managed.

In addition, with the database we will be able to map and visualize the DIYbio community and learn more from its geography and historicity. Moreover, we believe that this project will encourage collaboration between the community and will form a base for a worldwide network for DIYbio initiatives.

- Groups: exist in virtualspace or meatspace, but don’t have a dedicated space with lab equipment.
- Labs: are dedicated physical spaces with lab equipment. In rare cases they can be mobile.
- Startups:
- Incubators:
- Networks: bring initiatives together, sometimes for a common purpose or just for fun.
- Others: Anything that doesn’t quite fit in the previous categories,
