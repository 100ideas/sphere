# Overview of the DIYbiosphere
**What is it?**
The DIYbiosphere is a participatory project to create a database of Do-It-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world. The project is public; open for anyone to add and edit entries, as well as to shape the overall project.

**Why do it?**
The goal is to have a shared and common platform that can connect people and ideas in all its possibilities. With the open data we gather we plan to map and visualize the DIYbio community in all its diversity across time and space in the hopes that we may learn more about the movement and its futures.

**Who maintains it?**
The project is maintained by volunteer contributors and is managed by members of the [DIYbiosphere organization] in GitHub. You can also [join!]

**How is it organized?**
The database is categorized in nine kinds of entries:
