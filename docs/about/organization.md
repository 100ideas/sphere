The development community is composed by members of the [DIYbiosphere organization] in GitHub. [Request membership] to join us!. The benefit of being a [member](), and being in a [team](), is that you have more access permissions in the project.

## Permission Levels
There are different permission levels: _Read_, _Write_, _Admin_, and _Owner_. They are explained in much more detail by GitHub [here]().

We will explain the most important and relevant ones in this page which depend whether you are a member or not, and to what teams you belong to.

## Non-members
Anyone with a GitHub account can contribute to the DIYbiosphere project. However, their contributions require more steps since they have to go through revisions by the development team. Their basic actions are:

- Fork the repository
- Submit Pull Requests
- Submit an issue. Close their own issues
- Edit and delete their own comments
- Edit wikis

To edit the database, non-members have to fork, commit changes, submit a pull request, and wait for the merge by a member.

## Outside Collaborators
Non-members can be assigned more permission levels by making them _Outside Collaborators_ and specifying their access level.

## Members

- See other members and @mention them
- See teams and their members @mention teams, create new teams, and be team maintainer
- Manage Issues; close, reopen, assign, apply labels and milestones
- Edit and delete anyone's comments

To edit, members have to commit changes to the [editable], submit pull request, and merge it themselves.
