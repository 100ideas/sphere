We have several communication platforms you can use to get in contact with the development team:

**Github Issues**
You can submit a new issue to our [repository] with a [question], [suggestion], or a [request] to join as a member. You can even address particular users by mentioning them by username like @sabgaby. If you are a member of the [DIYbiosphere organization], you can address the project's [teams] as well. It should go without saying, but you need a GitHub account for this.

**Gitter**
Is a chat service that integrates with GitHub. You can freely join the [chatroom] for the repository. With Gitter, you can send a direct message to members of the chatroom; they have the same username as GitHub. You have to sign in with a GitHub account.

**Slack**
Is a very popular communication platform that offers integration with other services including GitHub notifications. You have to [request an invite] by inputing your email. You will instantly join the general channel but you may join others, or direct message other users.
