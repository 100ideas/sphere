We have several communication platforms you can use to get in contact with the development community:

**Github Issues**
You can submit a new issue to our repository's [Issues] tab with a [question], [suggestion], or a [request to join] as a member. You can mention users (like @ahuacatl) and [teams] only if you are a [member]. It should go without saying, but you need a GitHub account for this.

**Gitter**
Is a chat service that integrates with GitHub. You can freely join the chatroom: [gitter.im/DIYbiosphere/sphere.dir] for the repository. With Gitter, you can send a direct message (DM) to users in the chatroom; they have the same username as GitHub.

**Slack**
Is a very popular communication platform that offers integration with other services including GitHub notifications. We have our own Slack: [DIYbiosphere.slack.com]. You have to [request an invite], which you receive by email. You will instantly join all the channels, but you can leave or mute them.  Post your message in a channel or DM other users.
