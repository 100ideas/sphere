We have several communication platforms you can use to get in contact with us. here we explain and detail some of them:

[GitHub Issues]
in our Issues tab, you can [submit a new issue] with a question, suggestion, or a request to join as a member. You need a GitHub account for this.

[Gitter]
This is a chat service that integrates with GitHub (you need a GitHub account). there is a general chatroom for the repository, and anyone can join and see the chat history. here you can also see other of the project's members (same GitHub username) and send them a direct message. 

[Slack]
Slack is a communication platform that easies comversation. a lot of people use it and it integrates well with other services. You have to input your email and to get an invitation to the service. You will instantly join thr general channel but you may join others, or direct message other people.
