We have several communication platforms you can use to get in contact with the development team:

**Github Issues**
You can submit a new issue to our [repository] with a [question], [suggestion], or a [request] to join as a member. You can even address particular users by mentioning them by username like @sabgaby. If you are a member of the [DIYbiosphere organization], you can address the project's [teams] as well. It should go without saying, but you need a GitHub account for this.

**Gitter**
Is a chat service that integrates with GitHub. You can freely join the [chatroom] for the repository. With Gitter, you can send a direct message to members of the chatroom. They have the same username as GitHub.

**Slack**
Slack is a communication platform that easies comversation. a lot of people use it and it integrates well with other services. You have to input your email and to get an invitation to the service. You will instantly join thr general channel but you may join others, or direct message other people.
