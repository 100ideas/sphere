title: Development Community
---

In this section we explain how the project is managed by the development community of the DIYbiosphere.

The development community is composed by members of the [DIYbiosphere organization] in GitHub. [Request membership] to join us! The benefit of being a [member](#members), and being in a [team](#teams), is that you have more, and more access permissions to the project.

## Permission Levels
There are different permission levels: _Read_, _Write_, _Admin_, and _Owner_. They are explained in much more detail by GitHub [here]. The most important and relevant ones are explained in this page.

## Non-members
Anyone with a GitHub account can contribute to the DIYbiosphere project. Their contributions require more steps since they have to go through revisions by the development community. Basic actions of non-members are:

- Fork the repository
- Submit Pull Requests
- Submit an issue. Close their own issues
- Edit and delete their own comments
- Edit wikis

To edit the database, non-members have to fork, commit changes, submit a pull request, and wait for the merge by a member. See the tutorials for [adding an entry] and [editing an entry].

### Outside Collaborators
Non-members can be assigned more permission levels by making them _Outside Collaborators_ and specifying their access level.

## Members
All [Members] of the organization have _Write_ permissions. In addition to the actions of non-members, members can:

- See other members and mention them, like @ahuacatl
- See teams, create new teams, be team maintainer, and mention them, like [@DIYbiosphere/editors]
- Manage Issues and Pull Requests (PR); close, merge (PRs), reopen, assign, apply labels, milestones. See our [workflow management]
- Have Issues and PR assigned to them
- Edit and delete anyone's comments

To edit, members have to commit changes to the [editable branch], submit pull request, and merge it themselves. See the tutorials for [adding] and [editing] an entry for members.


### Teams
Members can join [Teams] which have specific functions and permissions. As a team member you have direct commit permissions to the master branch. Each team has a Team Maintainer who can add members to the team.

To edit, teams have to commit changes. See tutorials to [add] and [edit] entries for teams.

#### Managers
Every entry should have a manager. [Managers] are the representatives and the users responsable for their entry. In addition, managers can join the team for their entry's collection: [Projects], [Startups], [Labs], [Incubators], [Groups], [Networks].

#### Editors
Users who want to help manage content can join the [Editors] team. They are in charge of curating the database.

#### Coders
All those users who have coding skills and/or interested in the coding part of the project can join the [Coders] team.

#### Directors
All the users that have owner permissions. [Directors] oversee the development of the project. Their reponsabilities include:

- Inviting people to join the organization
- Manage teams and collaborators (add/remove, promote team maintainers)
- Manage the settings of the organization
- Enforce the [Code of Conduct]

Anyone can become a Director. Directors are expected to have the following characteristics

- A good grasp of the DIYbiosphere project
