_In this section we explain how the project is managed by the development community and how we organize._

Any, and all users who contribute to the project are considered _contributors_. The _development community_ refers to members of the [DIYbiosphere organization] in GitHub. [Members](#members) have greater access permissions to the project and can be part of [Teams](#teams) who are key members with distict roles in the development and enjoy greater access privileges. Submit an issue to [request membership] and join us!

## Access Permission Levels
There are different access levels: _Read_, _Write_, _Admin_, and _Owner_. They are explained by GitHub [here]. The most important and relevant ones are explained in this page.

## Non-members
Anyone with a GitHub account can contribute to the DIYbiosphere project. Their contributions require more steps to complete. Basic actions of non-members are:

- Fork the repository
- Submit Pull Requests
- Submit an issue. Close their own issues
- Edit and delete their own comments
- Edit wikis

To edit the database, non-members have to fork, commit changes, submit a pull request, and wait for the merge by a member. See tutorials for [adding an entry] and [editing an entry].

### Outside Collaborators
Non-members can be assigned more permission levels by making them _Outside Collaborators_ and specifying their access level.

## Members
All [Members] of the organization have _Write_ permissions. In addition to the actions of non-members, members can:

- See other members and mention them, like @ahuacatl
- See teams, create new teams, be team maintainer, and mention them, like [@DIYbiosphere/editors]
- Manage Issues and Pull Requests (PR); close, merge (PRs), reopen, assign, apply labels, milestones. See our [workflow management] of tickets.
- Have Issues and PR assigned to them
- Edit and delete anyone's comments

To edit, members have to _commit_ changes to the [editable branch], submit a pull request, merge it themselves or wait for feedback from the community. See the tutorials for [adding] and [editing] an entry for members.

### Teams
Members can join [Teams] which have specific functions and permissions. As a team member you have **direct commit** permissions to the master branch, no need for pull requests. Each team has a Team Maintainer who can add members to the team.

To edit, teams have to only commit changes. See tutorials to [add] and [edit] entries for teams.

**The teams in the DIYbiosphere organization are:**

#### • Managers
Users in the [Managers Team] are all those responsable for the entry of their own initiative.  Managers should also join the _Collection Team_ their entry belongs to: **[Projects Team]**, **[Startups Team]**, **[Labs Team]**, **[Incubators Team]**, **[Groups Team]**, **[Networks Team]**, **[Events Team]**, and **[Others Team]**.

**Every entry should have a manager!!**

#### • Editors
Users who are active in the management and development of all (non-software) content should be part of the [Editors Team]. As editors they are in charge of curating the database and all of its entries.

Managers are not involved in discussions about the the development of the project, this is the job of the Editors. Managers will be braught to the discussion at later stages before implementing any changes to the structure or content of the entries.
