# Getting Started
This is a quick guide to get you started.  Look out for [helpful hints].

## Before you Begin
By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct] (CoC), and consent to the [Contributor Terms] (CT). Please read them!

> TLDR: I will be nice to others and I freely share my contribution
>
> CoC: Be respectful! Don't be gross or rude to others; offenders will be prosecuted. Report offences to [project maintainers]
>
> CT: "I concede the rights of my Contribution to be distributed and/or modified under a _free_ license‚Äù

The **only requirement** you need to contribute is a GitHub account, so [Sign up] if you don't have one. If you are new to GitHub, the [GitHub Glossary] is an excellent starter!

## What can you contribute to?
There are four kinds of work in the project:
- the [database] is the entries of the DIYbio initiatives. These are plain text files with Markdown syntax. No skills required!
- the [documentation], or docs, is what you are reading right now and other guides and meta texts like it. These are also plain text files.
- the [build], or code, is the part that converts the text files into a readable website. Coding skills are helpful.
- the [design] is all about the user experience, the aesthetics and interface of the website. Design skills recommended.

## How do you contribute
Basically your options are the following:

  - [**Submit an issue**]: with your request, question, idea, and hope someone will pick it up. Follow the issue guidelines if you want to be taken seriously.
  - [**Comment, answer, and vote**]: Others may submit issues because they are asking a question, for help, or feedback.
  - [**Fork, commit, and pull request**]: your contribution! This is the best part of being an open-source project. Step-up and Do-it-Yourself :smile:!
