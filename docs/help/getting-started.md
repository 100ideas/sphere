# Getting Started
This is a quick guide to familiarize yourself with the work of the project. Look out for [helpful hints].

## Before you Begin
The **only requirement** you need to contribute is a GitHub account, so [Sign up] if you don't have one. If you are new to GitHub, the [GitHub Glossary] is an excellent starter! Otherwise, check out our [ELI5 guide].

Also, please be aware that by participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct] (CoC), and consent to the [Contributor Terms] (CT). Please read them!


## _What_ can you contribute to?
There are four types of work in the project:

- the database is the entries of the DIYbio initiatives. These are plain text files with [Markdown syntax]. No skills required!
- the documentation, or docs, is the guides, tutorials, and reference manual (like this page). These are also plain text files.
- the build, or code, is the part that converts the text files into data and a readable website. Coding skills are helpful.
- the design is all about the user experience, the aesthetics and interface of the website. Design skills recommended.

You can learn more about how these components were designed and structure in our [Basics] page.

## _How_ do you contribute
Your options, in order of engagement, are the following:

  - **Submit an issue**: with your [request], [question], [idea], and hope someone will pick it up. Follow the [issue guidelines] if you want to be taken seriously.
  - **Comment, answer, and vote**: Others may submit issues because they are asking a question, for help, or feedback.
  - **Fork, commit, and pull request**: your contribution! This is the best part of being an open-source project. Step-up and Do-it-Yourself :smile:!
