> How can I use the database? How can I obtain the entire dataset? How can I contribute with data? How can I get involved in the project?

This is the kickstart guide to help you get on the right path. Look out for [helpful hints].

TOC

## Using the Database
You can access the entries of the database on our website: [sphere.diybio.org]. In our home page you can directly search for entries with keywords (i.e. lab, Geneva, Bioscope) or do an `Advanced Search` with predetermined filters. {MAKE A GIF}.

### Table of Entries
You can see a list of entries with the search query, or filters if they were specified and you can further sort and filter the table, as well as do further searches within that table. {MAKE A GIF}

### Classification of the Entries
Entries have been classified broadly in eight classes:

- **Projects**: which are characterized usually for having specific tasks and/or a desired outcome
- **Startups**: are entrepreneurial ventures, and generally concern products or services
- **Labs**: are dedicated physical spaces with lab equipment for DIYbio related activities
- **Incubators**: are organizations and spaces that help projects, startups, etc. to develop
- **Groups**: are online/offline associations of people interested in discussing or developing DIYbio related topics or activities.
- **Networks**: website, service or organization that connects people, projects, etc. in relation to DIYbio
- **Events**: Global or regional events that are by and/or for the DIYbio community, like (un)conferences, camps, hackathons, accelerators, etc.
- **Others**: Is an umbrella term for the all the rest. Eventually as new entries begin to define themselves a new category may be created

### Anatomy of an Entry
The content of an entry is divided in two parts:

- The _written description_ of the initiative with the following suggested content:
  - **About**
  - **History**

- The _data_ is displayed inside an box in the right side of the page. This data is collected from Jekyll's _front matter_ with the following fields:

  - The **logo** or **title** of the entry and link to it's **homepage**
  - The **starting date** and end date if it applies; these entries are "inactive". In the Events class, this reflects the event's calendar
  - the **host**,
  - the **type** of initiative
  - the **affiliates**
  - the **address** and **directions**
  - the location which includes **city**, **postcode**, **state**, and **country**
  - the **keywords**
  - **social media** and more...

## Obtaining the Dataset
**Source**: The source-files are in the [sphere.dir] repository in GitHub, inside the folder `_database` in their respective class folder.

**List of entries**: in the websearch page of "List of entries", you can download the CSV of the displayed table.

**Complete data table**: All the filled-in data provided in the front matter section can be downloaded with the following links as [CSV] or [JSON]

## Contributing to the Database

## _How_ do you contribute
Your options, in order of engagement, are the following:

## _What_ can you contribute to?
There are four types of work in the project:

- the database is the entries of the DIYbio initiatives. These are plain text files with [Markdown syntax]. No skills required!
- the documentation, or docs, is the guides, tutorials, and reference manual (like this page). These are also plain text files.
- the build, or code, is the part that converts the text files into data and a readable website. Coding skills are helpful.
- the design is all about the user experience, the aesthetics and interface of the website. Design skills recommended.
