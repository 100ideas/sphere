# Basic components of the design of the project
> Explain how the components, design, code, database, and documentation are structured.

- *Projects*: have specific tasks and/or a desired outcome and don't fit within the other categories.
- *Startups*: are "entrepreneurial ventures", and generally concern products or services
- *Labs*: are dedicated physical spaces with lab equipment dedicated to support DIYbio related activities. Labs can be static or mobile.
- *Incubators*: are those organizations and spaces that help projects, startups, etc. to develop
- *Groups*: are associations of people (online, offline) that are interested in DIYbio related topics or activities. A group does not have a dedicated Lab space, but they may plan to have one.
- *Networks*: a website, service or organization that facilitates communication and collaboration between people, groups, organizations, etc. with interests in DIYbio.
- *Events*: Global or regional events that are by and/or for the DIYbio community, like (un)conferences, camps, hackathons, accelerators, etc. These are especially useful if something shareable is produced, like proceedings, videos, posters, etc.
- *Others*: Is an umbrella term for the all the rest. Eventually as new entries begin to define themselves a new category will be created.
