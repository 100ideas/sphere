> Rough Draft

This is a super simple/101/beginner/crash course/for dummies guide to help out the utterly confused. In this section we will explain

First.

What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web service that hosts your project folder (or {% include _oi/repo.html %} repository/repo), just like Dropbox, it's in their cloud/server
GitHub uses this software called Git,


## Forking

Pros

Keeps branches separated by user
Reduces clutter in the primary repository
Your team process reflects the outside contributor process
Cons

Makes it more difficult to see all of the branches that are active (or inactive, for that matter)
Collaborating on a branch is trickier (the fork owner needs to add the person as a collaborator)
You need to understand the concept of multiple remotes in Git
Requires additional mental bookkeeping
This will make the workflow more difficult for people who aren't super comfortable with Git

## Branching

Pros

Keeps all of the work being done around a project in one place
All collaborators can push to the same branch to collaborate on it
There's only one Git remote to deal with
Cons

Branches that get abandoned can pile up more easily
Your team contribution process doesn't match the outside contributor process
