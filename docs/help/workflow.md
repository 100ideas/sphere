In this section we detail the workflow of how the project is managed, specifically _Issues_ and _Pull Requests_ (PR), collectively refered to here as _Tickets_.

Tickets are classified and organized by [labels](#labels), [milestones](#milestones), [epics](#epics) and [boards](#boards). The two latter are features of [ZenHub] which we use for project management. It is free and has native integration with GitHub and works for Chrome and Firefox.

## Labels
Labels are for categorizing and filtering tickets. The following labels apply:

- {% include _labels/bug.html %} are errors, undesired results or behaviors
- {% include _labels/critical.html %} are high-priority tickets
- {% include _labels/database.html %} pertain to content and data
- {% include _labels/design.html %} pertain to the design
- {% include _labels/development.html %} pertain to the development of the code
- {% include _labels/documentation.html %} pertain to the documentation
- {% include _labels/easy.html %} are relatively simple, or for beginner contributors
- {% include _labels/enhancement.html %} are incremental or gradual improvements
- {% include _labels/Epic.html %} are part of an [Epic](#epics) issue
- {% include _labels/feature.html %} are new attributes, characteristics or functions
- {% include _labels/feedback.html %} are tickets that need opinions and comments
- {% include _labels/help.html %} are tickets that need other users to attend to
- {% include _labels/question.html %} are questions that need answers
- {% include _labels/resolution.html %} are tickets that need to be resolved soon


## Epics
Epics is a feature by ZenHub that groups issues together. Epics are useful to implement when any or many of the following apply to an issue:

- It is very complex
- It will require weeks or months to finish and close the issue
- It has several sub-tasks
- It relates to other issues of a similar theme of work

Issues should be maintained as modular as possible to encourage contributions.

## Milestones
Milestones act as container for issues or as events, or achievement goals. This is useful for associating issues with specific features or project phases. Milestones are groups of issues that correspond to a project, feature, or time period. Like Beta Launch, October, Sprint, Redesign.
Milestones are used to track the progress of similar issues and pull requests as they're opened and closed over time. At a glance, you can easily see the progress of work in a milestone's lifetime.


## Boards
Boards is a feature by ZenHub and is accesible as a tab. With boards, issues are classified along a development timeline as follows:

- New issues: where uncategorised issues go
- Discuss: are issues that should encourage contribut
- Future: are issues that would like to get address
- To Do:
- In Progress:
- Done:
- Closed:


## Assignment
Assigning tasks help the community know who they can reach out to to help with the issue or to collaborate and discuss further an issue or PR
