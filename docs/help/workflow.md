> Draft

In this section we detail the workflow of how the project is managed.

Issues and Pull Requests (PR) are classified and organized by [labels](#labels), [milestones](#milestones), [epics](#epics) and [boards](#boards). The two latter are features of [ZenHub] which we use for project management. It has native integration in GitHub and works for Chrome and Firefox.

## Labels
Labels are for categorizing and filtering issues. The ones in place for now include:

- {% include _labels/bug.html %} are errors, undesired results or behaviors
- {% include _labels/critical.html %} are high-priority issues
- {% include _labels/database.html %} pertain to content and data
- {% include _labels/design.html %} pertain to the design
- {% include _labels/development.html %} pertain to the development
- {% include _labels/documentation.html %} pertain to the documentation
- {% include _labels/easy.html %} are easy to tackle and follow issues
- {% include _labels/enhancement.html %} are incremental or gradual improvements
- {% include _labels/Epic.html %} are part of an [Epic] issue
- {% include _labels/feature.html %} are new attributes, characteristics or functions
- {% include _labels/feedback.html %} are issues that need opinions and comments
- {% include _labels/help.html %} are issues that need other users to attend to
- {% include _labels/question.html %} are questions that need answers
- {% include _labels/resolution.html %} are issues that need to be resolved soon


## Epics
Epics provide a hierarchy to issues. They are a theme of work that contains several sub-tasks needed to complete the larger goal.
If estimate the issue will take weeks or months to finish, it should probably become an
If it is too complex, if several sub-tasks are required to mark it as done it should be an

## Milestones
Milestones act as container for issues or as events, or achievement goals. This is useful for associating issues with specific features or project phases. Milestones are groups of issues that correspond to a project, feature, or time period. Like Beta Launch, October, Sprint, Redesign.
Milestones are used to track the progress of similar issues and pull requests as they're opened and closed over time. At a glance, you can easily see the progress of work in a milestone's lifetime.
