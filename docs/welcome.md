Start in the **Introduction**, to get a general [Overview] of the project, and to see some pointers on [Getting Started] in the project.

In **The Basics** section find all about the "blueprints" of the project: the [Entries], the [Software], the [Documentation], and the [Design].

The **Guides** are reference manuals for contributing and collaborating on the project: the [Contributing guide] shows how to submit issues and pull requests. The [Ticket Workflow] describes the organization of work tickets and the general development of the project. The [Writing Guide] is on how to write awesome entries. Our [GitHub ELI5] (Explain Like I'm 5) guide is great for newbies and for the utterly GitHub confused.

**Tutorials** are the _how-tos_ with step-by-step instructions, like for [adding new entries][add], [editing entries][edit], [using github], and much more.
