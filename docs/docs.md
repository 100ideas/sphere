This is the Documentation, or docs, part of the project where you can find all the information pertaining to the DIYbiosphere project.

Start with the **[Introduction]** section. Here you can get a general [Overview] of the DIYbiosphere project and our [Getting Started]  guide to using and contributing to the library.

Learn more about the [Development Community] and [Organization] behind the DIYbiosphere project in the **[About Us]** section. You can also learn about our external and internal [Communication] channels. It is very important for all users and contributors of the project to abide by our [Code of Conduct] so make sure to check it out.

Next, you should review our **[Copyright]** for the project. Users of the library should understand the [Terms of Use] attributed by our licenses ([MIT] & [CC0]) and contributors of the project should be aware and agree to the [Contributor Terms].

In **[The Basics]** section we describe the "blueprints" of the project in reference to its four kind of works: the [Library][library], the [Software], the [Documentation], and the [Design].

The first principals for contributing and collaborating on the project are laid out in our [Support] section. Find here the quintessential [Contributing Guide], members of the development team should also follow our [Workflow] guide for organizing the tickets in development. Reference back to our [Writing Guide] or to the [Glossary] of the project when in doubt. Our [ELI5 guide] (Explain Like I'm 5) is great for newbies and for the utterly GitHub confused. You

Follow any of our many how-to **[Tutorials]** with step-by-step instructions on [adding new entries][add], [editing entries][edit], [using github], and much more.

Finally, go to the **[Updates]** section. This should be the most dynamic section of the Documentation as it is continuously updates the [Changelog] (the past) and the [Roadmap] (the future) of the project. We have a small [Blog] where we contributors share their experience and thoughts on the project.
