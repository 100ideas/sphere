This is the Documentation, or docs, where you can find all the useful and technical information on the DIYbiosphere project.

In **The Basics** section we provide information on the "blueprints" of the project: the [Entries], the [Software], the [Documentation], and the [Design].

The **Guides** are the reference manuals for contributing and collaborating ont he project: the [Contributing guide] shows how to submit issues and pull requests. The [Ticket Workflow] specifies the labeling, assignment, and so on for organizing tickets. The [Writing Guide] is for writing awesome entries. Our [GitHub ELI5] (Explain Like I'm 5) guide is great for newbies and for the utterly GitHub confused.

**Tutorials** are the _how-tos_ with step-by-step instructions, like for [adding new entries][add], [editing entries][edit], [using github], and much more.

In the **Help** find the [Glossary] of the project, and when in doubt see our [FAQ] section.
