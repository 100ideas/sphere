## Name
The name for the project: "DIYbiosphere", is inspired as an analogy to that of a "biosphere". A _biosphere_  is a global ecological system that integrates all living beings and their relationships. In this sense, the DIYbiosphere is supposed to reflect the social and technological systems of DIYbio--its people and artfifacts--as well as their relationships.

## Logo
The logo takes the earth sphere with a magnifying glass on right bottom corner displaying the DIYbio lab goggles from DIYbio.org.
The brand name uses 'Source Code Pro' font. 'DIYbio' has a 'semibold' weight, and 'sphere' has 'black' weight. Below are the svg files. And you can find the design files in Sketch here.

## User interface
The design of the website is based on using Semantic-UI. The colors for the website were kept at a minimal. Using mainly white, grey and black on the interface and leaving links in blue.
