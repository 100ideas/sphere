title: Design in DIYbiosphere
draft: true
---

By design, we meanall things concerning the user experience; the aesthetics and interface of the website.

## Name
The name for the project: "DIYbiosphere", is inspired as an analogy to that of a "biosphere". A _biosphere_  is a global ecological system that integrates all living beings and their relationships. In this sense, the DIYbiosphere is supposed to reflect the social and technological systems of DIYbio--its people and artifacts--as well as their relationships.

## Logo
The logo takes the earth sphere with a magnifying glass on the right bottom corner displaying the DIYbio lab goggles from [DIYbio.org][diybio].
The brand name uses 'Source Code Pro' font. "DIYbio" has a 'semibold' weight, and "sphere" has 'black' weight.
