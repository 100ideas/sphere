By design, we mean all things concerning the user experience; the aesthetics and interface of the website.

## Name
The name for the project: "DIYbiosphere", is inspired as an analogy to that of a "biosphere". A _biosphere_  is a global ecological system that integrates all living beings and their relationships. In this sense, the DIYbiosphere is supposed to reflect the social and technological systems of DIYbio--its people and artifacts--as well as their relationships.

## Logo
The logo takes the earth sphere with a magnifying glass on the right bottom corner displaying the DIYbio lab goggles from [DIYbio.org][diybio].
The brand name uses 'Source Code Pro' font. "DIYbio" has a 'semibold' weight, and "sphere" has 'black' weight.

## User interface
The colors scheme is kept at a minimal, using mainly white, grey, black and blue.

### Semantic-UI Library
We use [Semantic-UI][semantic] as the UI framework because it is simple to code.
