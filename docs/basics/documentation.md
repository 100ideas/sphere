The documentation refers to all guides, tutorials, and reference manuals that pertain to DIYbiosphere. These are in plain text files in markdown syntax in the `./docs/` folder in the repo, and at: sphere.diybio.org/docs. To make the documentation more easy to read, several add-ins such as _message boxes_ and videos, _pop-overs_, etc.

hello

## Message boxes
{% include messages/incomplete.html %}
There are four types of message boxes:

{% include messages/info.html title="Labels can be for PRs" text="Labels will be applied mostly to Issues. However, when PRs require review or encounter problems in merging, labels may be applied to indicate any additional information (like 'critical', 'help wanted')." %}


{% include messages/exclamation.html title="Labels can be for PRs" text="Labels will be applied mostly to Issues. However, when PRs require review or encounter problems in merging, labels may be applied to indicate any additional information (like 'critical', 'help wanted')." %}


{% include messages/question.html title="Labels can be for PRs" text="Labels will be applied mostly to Issues. However, when PRs require review or encounter problems in merging, labels may be applied to indicate any additional information (like 'critical', 'help wanted')." %}

{% include messages/star.html title="Labels can be for PRs" text="Labels will be applied mostly to Issues. However, when PRs require review or encounter problems in merging, labels may be applied to indicate any additional information (like 'critical', 'help wanted')." %}


code files for the hints are in the `_include` folder
