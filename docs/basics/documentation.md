The documentation refers to all guides, tutorials, and reference manuals that pertain to DIYbiosphere. These are in plain text files in markdown syntax. In addition, there are several add-ins, such as _hints_, GIFS and expandable tutorials and _pop-overs_.

## Hints
There are four types of hints:

{% include messages/info.html %}


The code files for the hints are in the `_include` folder


## Wiki
In the wiki of github we post more detailed content on how to write and code for the DIYbiosphere project.
