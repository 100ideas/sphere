The documentation refers to all guides, tutorials, and reference manuals that pertain to DIYbiosphere. These are in plain text files in markdown syntax in the `./docs/` folder in the repo, and at: sphere.diybio.org/docs. To make the documentation more easy to read, several add-ins such as _message boxes_ and videos, _pop-overs_, etc.

## Message boxes
There are four types of message boxes:

{% include messages/info.html %}

{% include messages/exclamation.html %}

{% include messages/question.html %}

{% include messages/plus.html %}

code files for the hints are in the `_include` folder
