title: The DIYbiosphere Project
---

The DIYbiosphere collects and maintains entries on Do-it-Yourself biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world in a distributed manner, similar to a wiki but using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The project is participatory and completely open-source. Everyone can access and (re)use the content at [sphere.diybio.org][sphere], which is dedicated to the public domain, except where otherwise noted. Anyone can also contribute to the project: _writers_ [add] or [edit] entries, and _developers_ parcipate in the development; the software, design, and overall direction of the project. Go to the repository at [DIYbiosphere/sphere] to see how to get started to contribute. You can also get more involved and [become a member][join] of the [development community].

DIYbiosphere has four main goals. One is to create a central platform to find and learn about DIYbio initiatives. Two is to provide the DIYbio community a simple way to post and share their initiatives. Three is to have an open-source project to foster connection to DIYbio projects, people, and ideas. And four is to map and visualize the DIYbio community. Learn more about our mission, vision, and values in [our philosophy] page.
