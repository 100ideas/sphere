As an open source project, anyone can freely contribute to DIYbiosphere! Only a GitHub account ([sign up]) is necessary. Users who join the [DIYbiosphere organization] are actively involved in contributing and developing the project. The organization is divided into several **teams** with specific roles:

- **Board of Directors:** oversee the general direction and development of the project. They also have _admin_ and _owner_ control over the sphere repository and the DIYbiosphere organization respectively.
  - Jason Bobe: Chief Executive Officer - @JasonBobe
  - Gabriela A. Sanchez: Chief Project Officer - @sabgaby
- **Core Developers:** coordinate the software and the content of the entries as well as their design. They have _admin_ access to the sphere respository
  - Mac Cowell: Chief Technical Officer - @100ideas
- **Editors:** are in charge of curating entries and their content
- **Managers:** are all users who are in charge of one or many entries

## How to join
Join the organization and benefit from direct _writing_ permissions to the files without {% octicon repo-forked height:12 %} _forking_ or {% octicon git-pull-request height:12 %} _pull requests_. It makes editing files real easy and quick.

- Create a {% octicon issue-opened height:12 %} [new issue] with the title "Membership request". You can optionally add information about yourself in the description and if you would like to join a specific team.

## Partners
The project is developed in partnership with the [DIYbio.org](https://diybio.org/) network.

If you would like to become a partner, please contact @sabgaby or @JasonBobe.
